- my 9-5 is building geospatial stuff with [C-CORE](https://c-core.ca/)
- working on many different personal sites, with different goals (but all for fun, and made using [Astro](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/babble-bin/))
- attending [CTSNL](https://ctsnl.ca/) weekly meetups every week
- likely using [logseq](https://logseq.com/) to keep track of me, and what i am at
- checking my [miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) feed reader instance for new posts galore, and trying to think of what will be my first post over on my posts tab...
- attempting alongside [dan](https://danielpower.ca/) to keep a bi-weekly post up on our respective blogs, mine being ['babble bin'](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/babble-bin/)
