- my 9-5 is building geospatial stuff with [C-CORE](https://c-core.ca/)
- working on many different personal sites, with different goals (but all for fun, and made using [Astro](https://astro.build/))
- attending [CTSNL](https://ctsnl.ca/) weekly meetups every week
- likely using [logseq](https://logseq.com/) to keep track of me, and what i am at
- checking my [miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) feed reader instance for new posts galore, and trying to think of what will be my first post over on my posts tab...
