name: "Newfoundland/St. John's/Third Spaces"
---

I like [third spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place), which can be defined as so:

> In sociology, the **third place** refers to the social surroundings that are separate from the two usual social environments of [home](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home) ("first place") and the [workplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace) ("second place"). Examples of third places include [churches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_(building)), [cafes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffeehouse), [bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(establishment)), [clubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_(organization)), [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_library), [gyms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gym), [bookstores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookselling), [hackerspaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace), [stoops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoop_(architecture)), [parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park), and [theaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater_(structure)), among others. In his book *[The Great Good Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Good_Place_(Oldenburg))* (1989), [Ray Oldenburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Oldenburg) argues that third places are important for [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy), [civic engagement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_engagement), and a [sense of place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense_of_place).

My list of spaces, will likely be very software developer oriented, so spots that are comfortable to pop open a laptop, and do some reading / writing / working / vibing.

I'm also a fan of some form of hot beverage being _close_ by, but its not a requirement.

I am going to list some _paid_ places as well, which do fall more into the workplace category, but since my interest into programming usually blends between what I consider personal time and professional time, I'm going to be including them here.

[Bannerman Brewery](https://www.bannermanbrewing.com/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
In the mornings a cafe, for the longest time it would become a restaurant mid-day, I'm honestly [not sure that's a thing anymore](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/namjim-closure-downtown-st-johns-1.7434573), so maybe you don't get kicked out from the cafe around 12 anymore?

Really great spot though, great beverages, great tables to work from, sometimes the WiFi is a bit spotty, but honestly not a spot I find I'm ever _really_ productive at, mostly just a spot to sit with friends and chat.

I've spent some time here, it gave dentist office vibes without a lot to make it worthwhile, unless you _really_ need a spot to remote work from because you'd go stir crazy otherwise.

Affiliation, as in, there isn't an price tag on getting into the place explicitly, you sort of have to either be invited, or be affiliated with said entity to use the space:

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
The [Get Building](https://get-building.ca/) _Building_

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
170 Water Street, door to a staircase, on the second floor.

Check the [events posted on Luma](https://lu.ma/getbuilding), Jan puts out community co-working sessions at the moment while the space is still in a sort of _figuring itself out_ state.

</div>
[Emera Innovation Exchange](https://www.genesiscentre.ca/eix)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
Located in the [Signal Hill Campus](https://www.mun.ca/signalhill/), the old [Battery Hotel](https://www.mun.ca/signalhill/about/).

There's a bunch of space here for all sorts of things, a lot of event space, but on the bottom floor is a office / coworking spot that's _quite nice_.

I tried looking for pictures _I_ took of this place, but the best I found was this video of myself and Mitchell in September of 2022:

<video controls src='/asset/toyota_1745109692700_0.mp4' width='200' height='355'></video>

Mitch was a [SiftMed](https://www.siftmed.ca/) at the time (I think when they were called ReportMate?), hence he had access to the space, and basically just snuck in.

Rest in Peace / no longer a thing:

[Element Coffeebar & Lounge](https://www.instagram.com/elementcoffeenl/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
(Used to be) located at 516 Topsail Rd, same parking lot as [Burger King](https://www.burgerking.ca/store-locator/store/3382/520-topsail-road--st-johns--newfoundland/labrad--a1e-2c5).

The [CTSNL](https://ctsnl.ca/) meetups occurred there post covid.

It was open till 12, served decent food, treats, and beverages, even _alcohol_ if that was your speed.

Had some slots in the back for folk that wanted to gamble their lives away, but obviously wasn't enough to keep this place afloat.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
Or it was a front for something else, that also felt like a possibility but was never confirmed by us.

[Common Ground](https://mycowork.space/st-johns/coworking-spaces/common-ground-coworking)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
Its original spot was, at least when I knew of it, 30 Harvey Rd, close to the RNC building / the [Tims on Harvey Road](https://locations.timhortons.ca/en/nl/st-johns/78-harvey-rd/) / The Rooms.

The [Genesis Coworking](/newfoundland/st-johns/third-spaces#genesis-coworking) spot sort of replaced it.
