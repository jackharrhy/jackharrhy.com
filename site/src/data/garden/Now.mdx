My 9-5 is building legal AI stuff with [Spellbook](https://spellbook.legal/).

Working on many different personal sites, with different goals (but all for fun, and made using [Astro](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/babble-bin/)).

Attending [CTSNL](https://ctsnl.ca/) weekly meetups every week.

Likely using [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) to keep track of me, and what I am at.

Checking my [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) feed reader instance for new posts galore, and trying to think of what will be my first post over on my posts tab…

Climbing walls @ [The Cove](https://www.covebouldering.com/).
