> ```c
> globals.SpawnEntities = SpawnEntities;
> ```
> This function is called from the engine at each map start. If you look in > game.h you can see that this function takes three parameters. The first is the name of the map, the second, and most interesting, is something declared as char *entstring, and finally the third is the spawnpoints for something which was not possible to put in the map (The code says it has something to do with coop respawns, strange).
>
> The entstring is really a very long string, actually the ascii part of a map which can be seen using a hex viewer. It looks like a lot of c structs, and contains all the entities and the coordinates. That part is being sent in here for parsing, so if you wanted to, you could change the entity definition for map files TOTALLY.
