my .plan

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

april 20th, 2025:

added features to this site, breadcrumbs, better slugs

backlog of linkblog things, thinking of making a linkblog entry thats just a dump of whats in my raindrop.io and sort of just... not doing _much_ in the way of talking about them

linkblogs are basically an annotated version of my bookmarks, which i love, but they are taking me away from doing anything productive / cool that i could be writing about, since a lot of my free time and energy is spent writing about _other_ people
