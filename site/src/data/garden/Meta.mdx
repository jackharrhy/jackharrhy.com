[[Now]] should populate https://jackharrhy.dev/now/ , not via an API call from the website, but if there is an update to the page here, it should be able to push a commit to my website repo.

This thing should always be building, but I want a web interface for it so I can review updates before they go live.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)]">
For example, I might not want certain pages to actually be public, since the Logseq graph that powers this is also where I have a lot of personal stuff I'd rather not on the public internet.
</div>

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)]">
Also, if this place has an RSS feed, I'd be curious _when_ new updates would go out, or potentially see that something was updated when it was just a minor spelling change, therefore I wouldn't want an update.
</div>

RSS feeds for new posts / updates to posts.

Overall, just migrating more of what I have had private in my graph for years, into the garden.
