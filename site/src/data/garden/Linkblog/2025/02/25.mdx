["using" in Odin lang simplifies my entity system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UidiNCZVPKw)

Karl discusses Odin's [`using`](https://odin-lang.org/docs/overview/#using-statement-with-structs) feature in the context of structs.

```odin
Entity :: struct {
  ...
}

PlayerCat :: struct {
  ...
}

EntityInst :: struct($T: typeid) {
  using entity: ^Entity,
  using var: ^T,
}

update_player_cat :: proc(p: EntityInst(PlayerCat)) {
  ...
}
```

The gist of it is the above code, is that instead of update_player_cat being handed a `Entity`, which it would have to do some finagling with to ensure its a `PlayerCat` that has the same properties as `Entity`, it can instead expect to be passed a _`EntityInst`_, something that is ensured to have all of the properties of both `Entity`, _and_ `PlayerCat`, without even needing to do `p.entity`, or `p.player_cat`, _all the attributes on that struct will be accessible as your are programming simply from `p`.

Very cool.

More text drawing from Tomasz, this time using WebGPU.

Done the _proper way_ based on the work [Valve did in 2007](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf).

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Since Skin Deep is based on [dhewm3](https://dhewm3.org/), which itself is based on the [original Doom 3 Source code](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3), which is [GPL licensed](https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-3/blob/master/COPYING.txt), the changes the game has made to the engine have been released in the _demo_ for it (which I have played and is very fun).

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

I cloned the repo and did a dive into it to see if there was anything fun...

And then I ran into [`neo/d3xp/bc_banana.h`](https://github.com/DanielGibson/SkinDeep/blob/main/neo/d3xp/bc_banana.h), which contains the _amazing_ field, _`hasBecomePeel`_

Thank god for `//don't make it turn into a banana peel right on spawn`.

Karl's game jam game made during 48 hours, of which you can see him [making it live here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxE7SoPYTef2XC-ObA811vIefj02uSGnB).

Using his [Odin + Raylib _hot reloading_ template](https://github.com/karl-zylinski/odin-raylib-hot-reload-game-template)

Good project, and honestly, [fun game](https://zylinski.itch.io/the-legend-of-tuna)!

> This is a program that can generate a texture based on a bunch of other textures. This bigger texture is called an atlas. Using an atlas can make your game's rendering code faster since the number of draw calls can be reduced.

Need to get texture atlases into my Odin game, this will probably be the play.

Another Karl banger.
