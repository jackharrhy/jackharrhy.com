Amazing (as always) video on graphics programming by Acerola.

Hyped to see them not only using Godot, but already trying to [contribute back to the ecosystem of tooling](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Acerola-Compute) to help folks who know how things work in Unity more easily port their stuff over to Godot.

Probably one of the craziest technical showcase videos I've seen in a while.

Amazing editing too.

The dedication from the creator to the craft is unmatched.

[@mayfer - love when @mrdoob spent a decade making shadows, lighting & other shaders simple one-liners and then claude gets all the credit lol](https://x.com/mayfer/status/1894265694117924878)

All the people being like, _wow Claude made a full 3D game wowowowow_, when really, (while it is still neat), is just Claude throwing together enough Three.js to piece _some_ semblance of a game together.

No, Claude is _not_ rendering that scene...

I knew the [Valve paper](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf) on SDFs, but wasn't aware about [this amazing master's thesis...](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdfgen/files/3050967/thesis.pdf)

This is the Valve method:

And this is their method:

Obviously the GPU texture is multichannel _nonsense_, but look at the _crisp_ result.
