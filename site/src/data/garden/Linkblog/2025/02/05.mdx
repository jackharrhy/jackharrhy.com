[`du`](https://linux.die.net/man/1/du) is nice, [`dust`](https://github.com/bootandy/dust) is better for cleaning up file space, but _wiper_ looks like exactly what TUI I've been looking for.

[Move on to ESM-only](https://antfu.me/posts/move-on-to-esm-only)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> With the rise of [Vite](https://vite.dev/) as a popular modern frontend build tool, many meta-frameworks like [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Astro](https://astro.build/), [SolidStart](https://solidstart.dev/), [Remix](https://remix.run/), [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/), [Redwood](https://redwoodjs.com/), and many others are all built on top of Vite nowadays, that **treating ESM as a first-class citizen**.

> The capability to require() ESM modules in Node.js, initiated by 
JOYEECHEUNG, marks an incredible milestone. This feature allows packages to be published as ESM-only while still being consumable by CJS codebases with minimal modifications.

Goodbye `require()`, you did good, but its time to move on.

[Robert Yang's](https://debacle.us/) brilliant free online resource [The Level Design Book](https://book.leveldesignbook.com/) is very high quality, lots of great references to tools / practices / discussion of level design at a high level.

> KLETKA is a co-op (up to 6 players) horror game about going down in an elevator that is trying to eat you. Feed the elevator, explore deadly floors and descend deeper.

Picked this up yesterday, already had a great session myself and some friends.

Clearly some big inspo from [Lethal Company](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1966720/Lethal_Company/).
