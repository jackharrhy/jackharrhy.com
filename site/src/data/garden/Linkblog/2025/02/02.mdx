I love being a lassoer.

[Why does AI slop feel so bad to read?](https://www.seangoedecke.com/on-slop/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> Not everyone is bothered by AI slop. Presumably the people building or buying AI slop machines (automated LinkedIn engagement bots, for instance) don’t find it gross themselves, or they wouldn’t think it was useful.

> To summarize: **slop is bad because it’s very unpleasant to mentally shift from a human-human interaction to a human-machine one**. If you start out in a human-machine mindset (like when you’re using ChatGPT), or if you’re never in a human-human mindset in the first place [...], there’s no problem.

I threw a `<script>` tag into my `Layout.astro`'s `<head>`, so now anyone who visits my site (without an adblocker) will be _known_ to me.

Easy install, nice UI.

> **Gamedev City** is a community centered around the aggregation of links and resources for game development

I found a link to this lobstr.rs-esq site not long ago, I forget where, but its _easily_ become my most anticipated feed to get blog posts from.

If you RSS, put `https://gamedev.city/rss` into your feed reader _now_.

I also _just_ got my own account there, https://gamedev.city/~jackharrhy , which means, due to the magic of its [invitation tree](https://gamedev.city/users), I can now give others, so feel free to [[Contact]] me for a invitaiton!

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
The invitation tree was actually what inspired the system of invitations I built for [[Projects/stickertrade.ca]], I never actually opened it up so people who were not myself could invite people, but I built a data model that eventually one day Stickertrade would _also_ have a `/users` page, showing the lineage of invites.

Taylor has it down pat, I am going to _implement_ all of these at work, maybe even I will become the extremely lucky ultra rare shiny 11x developer...

[Comic strip archive RSS feed](https://wolf.nereid.pl/posts/comic-strips/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Neat approach of wanting to consume a large amount of some feed (in this context comic strips), and instead of just having _all of them be given to you all at once_, setting up a slow drop of content from that feed so you can consume it as if it was coming out at a slow rate into you feed reader.

I could see myself setting up this for [xkcd.com](https://xkcd.com/)...

Month end means some people who have been doing this internet garden / website with all the things _thing_ for much longer than me have enough to do a monthly round up.

This is one hell of a monthly round-up, since you've now just reached the end of mine, if you are hungry for more, rather than hitting the back button, go _forward_ to Wouter's website!
