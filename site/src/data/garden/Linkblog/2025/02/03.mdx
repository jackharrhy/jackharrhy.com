[Three Days of Cursor](https://loufranco.com/blog/three-days-of-cursor)

> [...], I feel very much like I am still programming. I am sequencing the work. It feels like it’s reading my mind since I do know exactly how to do what I am asking, but it’s saving a lot of typing.

> The main way it helps me though, is to keep me in flow. [...] It’s just a lot of little things that save time and let me move on to something else.

Big cursor fan, I was skeptical when I heard there was a _AI VSCode fork_, but then I tried it myself, and I haven't looked back.

[Unexpected Benefits of Building Your Own Tools](https://tiniuc.com/make-more-tools/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Writing small little tools to solve problems is always fun, be it [scraping a publicly data source for historical records](https://github.com/jackharrhy/metrobus-timetrack-history), or [a Discord / Telegram bot that posts houses available in your area / price range](https://github.com/jackharrhy/get-house-pls).

I'd like to build more of these tools, but its also something that I don't think you can force, you just need some introspection on _is there something I do often that I can make easier_.

> *Hollywood* is a utility will split a computer console into a multiple panes of genuine technical melodrama, perfectly suitable for busy-looking computers in the background.

[Billy Basso on code architecture of Animal Well! - Game Engineering Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YngwUu4bXR4)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
I've seen interviews from Billy Basso before, but a big fan of this one since its very focused on the game from a technical perspective.

Hearing him talk about the early days of when he still had a day job is fun, how a side project consumed him to the point he felt comfortable to take the plunge and just work on it full time.

[Adding Webmentions to a static Astro site](https://kld.dev/adding-webmentions/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Been looking into adding [Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) support to this site, ran into this article, will hopefully be all I need to get that on the go!

Always love a `@jaredsummer` post that opens up with _In the next version of Bun_.

Curious if this will became the new hotness to pull me away from Vite...
