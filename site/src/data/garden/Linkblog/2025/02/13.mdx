[Joel Auterson - My favourite command-line tools](https://www.joelotter.com/posts/2025/02/command-line-tools/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> A friend got a MacBook recently and was asking for recommendations. I found myself wishing I had a list of all my default-installed command-line tools, so that’s what this is.

Some good recommendations here, the ones mentioned that I am a fan of have to be:

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux): Terminal Multiplexer.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Have one terminal emulator pane but want many terminals? GNU Screen not enough? _tmux_!

Whenever I enter a project directory in [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) (usually via [z](https://github.com/jethrokuan/z)), I immediately do `tmux` so I can invoke `npm run dev` / `mix -S phx.server` / etc., and have another pane or window to do other things.

I leave mine _unconfigured_, it comes out of the box green and beautiful.

</div>
[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A cat(1) clone with wings.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Its `cat`, but line endings, syntax highlighting, git diff displaying.

Very nice for quicky looking at a `.yml` / `.ts` / etc. file in the terminal.

</div>
[jq](https://jqlang.org/): sed for JSON data.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
I don't use `jq` very often, but when I do need to write some scripts working with JSON, it is truly the swiss army knife.

</div>
Joel talks about Neovim near the end of his article:

> This is another one that ought to be its own post, really, and I don’t want to start a holy war in here, so I will simply say that Neovim is my single favourite piece of software that I use.

Maybe one day I will give Neovim a proper go, but honestly, while I consider myself a terminal enjoyer, VSCode (and its many growing forks) just sparks enough joy I don't have the bother to learn something else.

[pjg1.site - How does a Linux machine connect to the internet, really?](https://pjg1.site/linux-internet-from-scratch)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> [...] I disabled NetworkManager and systemd-resolved (both running as systemd services) and set the network interface to down:
>
> ```
> # systemctl stop NetworkManager
> # systemctl disable NetworkManager
> Removed "/etc/systemd/system/network-online.target.wants/NetworkManager-wait-> online.service".
> Removed "/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/NetworkManager.service".
> Removed "/etc/systemd/system/dbus-org.freedesktop.nm-dispatcher.service".
> # systemctl stop systemd-resolved
> # systemctl disable systemd-resolved
> # ip link set dev wlp3s0 down
> ```

> With this, the machine is no longer connected to the internet.

Under these conditions, Piya, goes through the process of using [ip](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ip) to wire up the system back to the internet, command by command.

> **tl;dr**: yes, although I found an approach without ZWJ. In fact, you can encode data in any unicode character.

An _incredible_ abuse of unicode.

[antirez - Reasoning models are just LLMs](https://antirez.com/news/146)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
At work today I asked `o3-mini` what model it was, thinking it would know it was `o3-mini`, it didn't, because as a coworker reminded me, it is _just_ distilled / differently handled `4o` / `4` / `secret-openai-sauce`.

antirez discusses the [s1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19393) paper in this article, which I've [read about over on Xe's site](https://xeiaso.net/notes/2025/s1-simple-test-time-scaling/) as well, which is a simple method to just force a regular GPT model to keep generating tokens even after it decides to throw in its end of the line special token.

This is basically the entire s1 approach:
```
WHILE reasoningEffort > 0
    Decrease reasoningEffort

    IF reasoningEffort != 1
        Clear stop tokens from buffer
        Append "Wait" to buffer

    response = GenerateResponse(
        model = 'model-of-choice',
        prompt = buffer,
    )

    Append response to buffer
END WHILE
```

Its so silly, but it works!

[Marina Nitze - I Tried To Fix Government Tech for Years. I'm Fed Up.](https://reason.com/2025/02/13/i-tried-to-fix-government-tech-for-years-im-fed-up/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
I think the current state of the _states_, under the "watchful" eye of President Musk, it _not great_.

However, this article is a good read from a differing opinion of someone who worked at the USDS (the government entity DOGE consumed to skip the paperwork of setting up a brand new department), and the amount of red tape they ran into _trying_ to improve efficiency even in a small subset of the government.

Red tape sucks, I think there should be bodies in government that have the power to acknowledge when bureaucratic gridlock is occurring, with some oversight and control to _make stuff happen_ when needed.

But I think DOGE's "mandate" _far_ surpass the above.

Meh I don't think I want this linkblog to be political, all this is just such a big thing currently, I feel like I can't _not_ have something to say about it here, the same feed reader I consume technical content on is telling me all about the erratic country to my south.

I like when governments are boring and I can focus on computers.

Also, trans rights are human rights, trans people are real and exist, _fuck_ trans erasure.

Unreleased game, that is extremely pretty _very_ minimal graphics!

From screenshots it looked like concept art, but its beautiful concept art that _moves_!

[YouTube is going to let you put AI-generated video clips in Shorts](https://www.theverge.com/news/612031/youtube-ai-generated-video-shorts-veo-2-dream-screen)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
I first thought this was making clips from existing videos, which I could see being handy taking existing content and making it work better for shorts.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Like, if you had a longer form landscape video, feeding that to some system to spit out a vertical video shorts clip with catchy jumps and subtitles, while I still think editing is something that is better executed with _human_ creativity, I could see this having _some_ merit.

</div>
However, its not that at all!

> To access clip generation, Dream Screen users need to open the Shorts camera, open the media picker, and tap the “Create” option at the top. You can then enter a text prompt describing what you want to generate and select your desired style, lens, cinematic effect, and video length.

So it is just prompt, to video, to post-able short.

Cringe!

[nadako - Odin SDL3 GPU Tutorial: Part 1 - Basic Setup, A Red Triangle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfc3vschDVw)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Odin _and_ SDL3 in the same project, _very cool, very nice_.

The [SDL3 GPU API](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU) is very neat, the idea that SDL is involved in basically everything, not just here are the window, some inputs, but you bring a graphics API, is extremely interesting.

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

I'm pretty close to being able to run [the part 2 demo](https://github.com/nadako/hello-sdlgpu3-odin/blob/726959fb66b2994c73eb56cdf20588a2942970d1/main.odin) on my machine, the only thing blocking me is that the author has chosen to compile the shaders to [SPIR-V](https://www.khronos.org/spirv/), which is extremly sensible, since they're on Windows, an environment Vulkan functions, as well as Linux, but I'm currently using _Mac_.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
The solution here that would be the most SDL-native, seems to be [SDL_shadercross](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_shadercross), I'm currently trying to get this to build, but since it relies on [SPIRV-Cross](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Cross), I'm currently getting this during `cmake .` in SDL_shadercross:

```
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:136 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findspirv_cross_c_shared.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by [...]
-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
```

However I currently have [Natalie](https://ncashin.dev/) over, she ~~will~~ **_has_** save**_d_** me from my CMake perils ~~I'm sure~~.

I wrote the above line before _almost_ uploading this linkblog, I was authoring the description to this post (the last step usually, since I include a brief mention of each link in it), when Natalie asked me (she was doing math homework while I was cooking most of this) about my GPU woes.

After some messing around with CMake (installing the CMake GUI to have a better time seeing what variables the CMakeList wanted to configure), downloading the _entire_ Vulkan SDK for MacOS, figuring out the right paths the GPU_Shadercross library wanted, using the `shadercross` binary to spit out `msl` (Metal) shaders from the existing SPIRV shaders in the example, changing over the `main.odin` file to use the right directives for MSL, BOOM!:

Natalie the goat, thank you.

<div class="ml-[calc(3*1rem)] mb-8">
Also Natalie quite liked the SDL3 GPU API, which sparks joy, I always assumed it was good but having someone like her confirm it (she is Vulkan-pilled) is good.

Zed seems to be taking notes from Cursor, nice to see!

I've used Zed for its multiplayer functionality, which works surprisingly well, I do think its lagging behind in AI functionality, but this is a step in the right direction.

[Selena Anderson - Don’t Be Frupid](https://selix.net/notes/dont-be-frupid)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> Frugality is a virtue. The art of doing more with less, making sharp trade-offs, and keeping waste at bay so the good stuff – innovation, growth, maybe even a little joy – has room to thrive. Any engineer worth their salt knows the power of an elegant, efficient solution. A few well-placed optimizations can turn a sluggish system into a rocket.
>
> But frugality has a dark twin – a reckless, shortsighted impostor that mistakes cost-cutting for efficiency and penny-pinching for wisdom. Enter frupidity, or stupid frugality – the obsessive drive to save money in ways that ultimately cost far more in lost productivity, morale, and sanity. It’s the engineering equivalent of “optimizing” a car by removing the brakes to improve gas mileage.

This article came up in discussion about work computers, and if you always need to get something beefy or if something _okay_ would get the job done.

My current job spares no expense, and honestly, it sparks joy to be given a sleek workhorse to use for tasks.
