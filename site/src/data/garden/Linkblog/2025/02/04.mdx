[What is textmode?](https://polyducks.co.uk/pages/what-is-textmode/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> Textmode is a general term for tile art which is:
> - Created from a fixed two colour tileset (usually a 1bit font)
> - On a uniform grid
> - With at most a single foreground colour per character
> - With at most a single background colour per character

Very pretty.

Many great links to ways to go about this / people doing this sort of art on the interwebs.

Oracle [wants to dismiss](https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92086835&pty=CAN&eno=7) Deno's [attempt to free the JavaScript trademark](https://deno.com/blog/deno-v-oracle).

A lot of Oracle's claim is made simply based on them having an _active page on their website with a trademark sign for their JavaScript Extension Toolkit_.

Larry, focus more on that $500 billion you're part of with the US government for some reason than getting your gaggle of lawyer cronies defending usage of a term you _clearly_ have not made proper use of.

[Developer philosophy](https://qntm.org/devphilo)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> **Avoid, at all costs, arriving at a scenario where the ground-up rewrite starts to look attractive**
> It's generally pretty well-understood that the ground-up rewrite can be an attractive and extremely dangerous prospect. The standard advice when it comes to ground-up rewrites is "Don't, ever". But I want to take a step back from that.
> By the time the ground-up rewrite starts to seem like a good idea, avoidable mistakes have already been made. This is a scenario which you can see coming from a long way out and you can, and must, actively steer away from.
> Warning signs to watch for: compounding technical debt. Increasing difficulty in making seemingly simple changes to code. Difficulty in documenting/commenting code. Difficulty in onboarding new developers. Dwindling numbers of people who know how particular areas of the codebase actually work. Bugs nobody understands.

I like this viewpoint quite a bit, the idea that you don't even want to end up in a state a rewrite will be a consideration.

I've worked at companies in which technical debt is something that has occurred (who in software hasn't?), usually gained when we've had to move fast / bend in a direction a customer willing to throw us enough money has asked for.

Having stuff like this to bring up is good, since those companies as well have all been companies that have had _v1_ of their API, and a clear _v2_, if you _**do not want to have a v3, maybe not pile on the tech debt now?**_.

Great article, bringing up this specific point though:

I miss the days that Firefox would surface feeds by adding a RSS icon to the search bar. They made the web worse when removed that feature in my opinion; so [I added it back with an add-on I made](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/feed-and-blogroll-discovery/).

[Google expects to spend $75 billion this year on the AI race](https://www.theverge.com/news/606242/google-q4-2024-earnings)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
The amount of money being thrown into this space is mind boggling.

Maybe it will finally be enough to make Gemini Voice Assistant or whatever its called, the replacement for the somewhat perfectly fine Google Assistant on my Pixel, _actually good_.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Does anyone at Google even use the voice assistant? I was in my car the other week, had a cool idea, wanted to write it down, and the LLM _lectured me on how it can't do that because its a LLM_.

I asked it if it had access to my device, to which it explained to me, not, it does not.

5 minutes later, I used the same Gemini assistant to call a friend I was driving to, and the same voice that told me it could not touch my phone, just went, _sure_, and low and behold this app _can_ use (certain?) features on my phone!

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Once I parked, I figured out how to switch to the previous _legacy_ assistant, and asked it the same request to put something into my notes, and _it just did it, did not gaslight me into saying that it could touch my phone, it did the thing I asked it to._

I find my only time I'm using the voice assistant myself is during a time I require a truly hands-free experience.

<div class="ml-[calc(3*1rem)] mb-8">
I actually have had multiple times I'm in my car, while trying to do something basic, and I get the _stupid AI voice to start yapping back to me_, to the point I'm just shouting in my car at the idea that _this is what all those billions are being poured into_.

</div>
`</endrant>`, just build a freaking assistant that works, _please_.

Beautiful article, whenever I see something like this which has examples of the code / concepts in question with _sliders_ to view it under different conditions, I know proper _love_ has been put into it.

I'd like to get more shader-pilled.
