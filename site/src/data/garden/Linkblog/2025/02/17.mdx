[loops - There is no 1875 epoch](https://iter.ca/post/1875-epoch/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Interesting discussion about the significance, or lack thereof, of the date 1875 when it comes to Cobol.

Recent chatter has made fun of the DOGE crowd for not understanding Cobol, with the simple answer that: "0 in COBOL date is 1985", or something along those lines.

Does not seem like this is the case, if loops is to be trusted.

I agree heavily with the points brought up in this post, as someone who did in time eventually learn how to live with Poetry, but still found its interface to be less than preferable (also horrible slow at SAT solving the lockfile for my last works project...), `uv` (& co) just _do the thing_, and _do it really fast_.

[Michelle Barker - Debating the Merits of LLMs](https://css-irl.info/debating-the-merits-of-llms/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Michelle discusses Robin Sloan's [_Is It Okay_](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/is-it-okay/), the discussion of if LLMs are ethical.

The discussion of AI for _super science_ is interesting, Robin (who is a science fiction writer), mentions that AI used to cure cancer are obviously ethical due to the effect that it would have on society, but Michelle points out that _"LLMs are not this. They synthesise text, which is not the same as data. Particularly when they are trained on the entire internet, which we all know includes a lot of incorrect, discriminatory and dangerous information."_.

I would also like to see super-science produced information spit out of markov chains gone insane, but I think I see the perspective of Michelle, where that simply just isn't what they are meant to be, to extent beyond the latent space into the areas unknown, that probably has to be the human's doing, not the LLM.

I am _so_ team "prefer integration tests to unit tests", Carson also dunks on mocks, _mocks are evil, they are not real, you end up testing mocks, not testing your system._

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Note: Mocking an _external_ system, like if you are a company hitting OpenAI, I can understand wanting not to have an external system without consistent output to be under test, but in my opinion, _never_ mock things like your database, just build tooling around spinning up a fresh `CREATE DATABASE` on startup, and use something like transactions that rollback after a `describe(...)` block is ran to ensure tests don't run into each other.

> `oklch()`¬†is a new way to define CSS colors. In¬†`oklch(L C H)`¬†or¬†`oklch(L C H / a)`, each¬†item corresponds as follows:
> - `L`¬†is¬†perceived¬†lightness (`0%`-`100%`). ‚ÄúPerceived‚Äù means that it has consistent lightness for our eyes, unlike¬†`L`¬†in¬†`hsl()`.

New color syntax just dropped.

This is very cool to see in action, I've seen some clips of people just changing the hue angle, and things just sort of _work_ without having to modify the other values.

Depending on how you prompt, ChatGPT can be great at telling you the _how_ without the _why_, and the worst of it, is even if you ask it to explain itself, _you're likely not able to sus out if its lying to you_.

But, if Claude / OpenAI was a drug, I am definitely an addict, I tell myself that I still have been in the workforce before all this was a thing, therefore if I disconnected from the internet and ran no local LLM but still had access to GitHub / StackOverflow, I'd _survive_, but honestly, I haven't even tested what my skill level would be without the tools I am now extremely accustomed to using.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
The React team (many who work at Vercel) as pushing people towards frameworks over libraries, and honestly making the wording seem like you're a bit silly if you're even considering a library...

Mark Erikson [opened up a pull request to react.dev](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/7618) proposing changes to the published documentation.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
He is the maintainer of Redux, so obviously he has some considerable skin in the game, but I'd argue potentially someone a bit... well... behind the times in some aspects? If I hear a project is using Redux / RTK, I usually view it as a legacy project, Zustand / React Query all the way.

Not to put down his opinion, but just giving some important context.

</div>
Thankfully some [different changes](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/pull/7624) were merged in, which incorporate some of Mark's content, and overall just better wording in a few places.

But still, this is sort of frustrating to see, I am the first in line to say that frameworks like React Router v7 (Remix) / Next.js / SvelteKit / SolidStart / TanStack Start are the _way to go_ if you have the choice, but, the sheer _amount_ of people who just want to slap a React app up on a GitHub page, or already have a perfectly good SPA they've been maintaining at their job for years, cannot be forgotten about as just simply 'the old path'.

Evan You (of Vue / Vite fame), [spoke about](https://x.com/youyuxi/status/1891721924197351497) the hesitance of speaking fondly of Vite:

> Based on what I gathered, it feels the React team's hesitance on Vite (and build tooling in general) is how it aligns with their vision of React (i.e. RSC being the recommended paradigm), and how much influence / connection they have with the said tools to make sure the integration works as they designed and can adapt to design iterations.

I'm of the mind that Vite is perfectly poised where it currently stands, curious to know where this would even go.

But, in a [follow up Tweet](https://x.com/youyuxi/status/1892000761778929931), Evan says:

> Update: someone from the React team has reached out to me saying I am egregiously wrong.

> I apologize if this is not what the React team is thinking, but it‚Äôs my honest guess because I am just as puzzled as many React users by what took it so long for Vite to be better acknowledged as a recommended tool.
