Google'd for 'Box2D fishing', in relation to a game jam I'm currently working on, ran into this resource with some beautiful debug renderings of a 'fish' getting _impaled_.

Nice.

[idTech4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_4) never looked so good...

I might actual consider streaming my play through of this game, the immense vibes Brendon squeezes out of games is fantastic.

[floooh/sokol-odin - Odin bindings for the sokol headers](https://github.com/floooh/sokol-odin)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
[Sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) is cool, Odin is cool, Odin bindings for Sokol are _epic_.

I have been having a good time with SDL3 GPU, but I do intend at some point to give Sokol a go.

[mrdoob/three.js - Three.js Shading Language](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Extremely cool 'shading language' for Three.js, which honestly is more of a JavaScript amalgamation which lets stuff like this be possible:

```js
const posY = uniform( 0 ); // it's possible use uniform( 'number' )

// or using event to be done automatically
// { object } will be the current rendering object
posY.onObjectUpdate( ( { object } ) => object.position.y );

material.colorNode = posY;
```

Very cool API.
