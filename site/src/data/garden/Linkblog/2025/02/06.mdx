This is amazing.

I didn't even realize this way the same guy who did [one million checkboxes](https://eieio.games/blog/one-million-checkboxes/) until I went back to his main site.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
That project in itself, has some [amazing stuff to read about itself](https://eieio.games/blog/the-secret-inside-one-million-checkboxes/).

[GovWayback](https://govwayback.com/)

> Access historical versions of U.S. government websites from before January 20, 2025 with a simple URL change.

Lovely URL hacks like this are what keep me sane linking other people to the bird site.

Great we live in a timeline this also now has to be done for the American government as well.

Its like the entire "Thanks Obama" meme, now its "Thanks Elon", and much much much much much much much worse!

[NASA is going to do a Twitch stream from the ISS](https://www.theverge.com/news/607693/nasa-twitch-stream-iss)

Twitch stream from the ISS?

OBS on the moon when.

[lychee - ⚡ Fast, async, stream-based link checker written in Rust](https://lychee.cli.rs/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
I was looking into how [Eva Decker](https://eva.town/) is using Astro DB on her site, [which is thankfully open source](https://github.com/evadecker/eva.town/), and I notice a file name called `.lychee.toml`.

<Image src='/asset/lychee-hichew_1738886271028_0.png' alt='lychee-hichew.png' width={220} height={107} />

Recently, I have found some Hi-Chew in the international section of my local super market, in which Lychee was a flavour, so seeing `.lychee.toml` sparked joy, I had to go see what it was.

Turns out, it is a tool for finding dead links! This was something that I was concerned about, as someone who hates link rot, so having a dedicated tool to quickly check for link rot is great.

Even with no configuration file of my own, running `lychee .` in the root of my repo works well!

Great tool, thanks again to great website inspo from Eva!

[Asdf Has Been Re-Written in Golang](https://stratus3d.com/blog/2025/02/03/asdf-has-been-rewritten-in-go/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
I always respected [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/) for being written in pure bash, from a simplicity perspective, but this makes sense.

Go is great for a tool like asdf, especially when `CGO_ENABLED=0`-ing a binary that works on basically everything.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Its no [αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε](https://justine.lol/ape.html) though.

[Last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Last.fm has an API, its pretty good, and easy to get an API key for it.

<video controls src='/asset/currently-listening_1738896132817_0.mov' width='1712' height='1676'></video>

`/` now has a 'currently listening' display, powered by said API, and also [htmx](https://htmx.org/)!
