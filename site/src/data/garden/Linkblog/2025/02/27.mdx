Karl's cooked up a [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) + [Sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) + Hot Reload template, very very nice.

I'm thinking about taking this and making a similar template for SDL3 GPU, would be nice to have it in [my project](https://github.com/fogo-sh/arctic-char).

LocalThunk has a website he's writing longer form prose on!

Some great points on taking something you know people already know and love, and just remixing it into a game.

The tweet in question honestly doesn't really matter, but I resonate heavily with the idea that the amount of backwards compatibility and hesitance to make unreasonable changes is super high in the React community, people just want to be able to `npm install` without pinning to a previous version and not have to change or reconsider a line of code.

["Experimental responsive image support in Markdown"](https://astro.build/blog/astro-540/#experimental-responsive-image-support-in-markdown) looks very cool, I could use that in this site.

EA? Open sourcing games they could instead just resell?

Somebody pinch me...
