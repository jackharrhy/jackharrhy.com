[Karl Zylinski - Hot Reload Gameplay Code: What, why, limitations and examples!](https://zylinski.se/posts/hot-reload-gameplay-code/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
I've been on a bit of an [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) / [SDL3 GPU](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/CategoryGPU) bend as of late.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Myself and [Natalie](https://ncashin.dev/) have been cooking on ["arctic char*"](https://github.com/fogo-sh/arctic-char).

</div>
The previously mentioned [Billy Basso interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YngwUu4bXR4) made me curious if I was going to head into graphics programming land, it would be worthwhile early on to look into hot reloading.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Billy mentioned that very early on into the Handmade Hero series, [hot reloading is mentioned](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMSBRk5WG58), this def. made me think about trying to look into this early rather than a _down the line_ nice-to-have rfeature.

</div>
Anyways, Karl has a blog post on this, which is pretty concise and to the point with lots of code of how one can approach this!

I haven't gotten to the point in arctic char* to having a properly rendering mesh on the screen, but I think I'm going to be looking into this shortly, and this article is going to be what I base everything off of for sure.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
While just throwing 'SDL3 GPU' into Google, I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nAKl0B2H2E), curious if I can get hot shader reloading in as well...

</div>
Karl has also written a [book on Odin](https://odinbook.com/), I picked up a digital copy online, and charged up my Kobo (Thanks to [Steve](https://github.com/SteveParson) for sending it to me in the mail years ago, sorry it hasn't seen much use) so I can chuck it on it and _maybe just maybe_ read a physical book digitally for the first time.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
The likely hood is that I'm going to open up the `.html` for the book, and `Ctrl` + `F` as needed for when I want to learn about specific features...

[Web3 is Going Just Great - Zero Edge crypto casino enters liquidation after founder gambles away its seed money](https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/single/zero-edge-crypto-casino-liquidation)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> Richard Kim, the founder of the Zero Edge crypto casino, resigned on July 2, 2024 after blowing most of the project's seed funding. [...] Within a day of closing a seed financing round on June 20, Kim had begun putting the money into leveraged crypto bets, resulting in "the significant loss of company funds". On June 29, he admitted in an email to Zero Edge shareholders that he had blown around $3.67 million in company funds.

Always a fan of going for a dive on Floor796 to find some fun scenes / characters / references / etc.

Still haven't really bothered using Reddit very much since the API debacle that killed third party apps, lovely to see enshittification continue.

[Emma Roth - Mastodon will add quote posts, even though some users don’t want them](https://www.theverge.com/news/613376/mastodon-quote-posts-update)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> Mastodon is making a change that might have some users divided. In [an update on Friday](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2025/02/bringing-quote-posts-to-mastodon/), the decentralized platform [announced](https://mastodon.social/@MastodonEngineering/114003104286886445) that it’s working to add quote posts “to help people to transition away from proprietary, billionaire-owned social media to the open social web,” as [spotted earlier by *TechCrunch*](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/14/mastodon-is-working-to-add-the-controversial-quote-posts-feature/).

This is nice, obviously you can have a social media without the ability to quote posts, but quoting can be a nice way to discuss something / add to what someone else is saying in the context of a post of your own.

Good for fediverse.

[Ben Shumaker - Designing backgrounds with LLMs and React](https://www.vigilant.run/blog/designing-backgrounds-with-llms-and-react)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> Back in January, I made this startup's first landing page. I used Cursor to make an interactive background (like the one on this page). Within a couple days of publishing, multiple developers messaged me compliments. One even asked if I hired a professional designer.
>
> I was surprised by the feedback, because it was super easy to make. I basically just prompted and reprompted LLMs. Artistic components are perfect for AI: they're isolated, they can't cause serious damage, and you can verify the logic by looking at the result. Here's the React + Tailwind code, simplified a bit.

Being complemented for AI authored code is always weird, because although you were technically the prompter, and the one who is able to check it for a level of quality you deem fit, its not really _your_ code in some regards.

At work today, my coworker was asking to refactor some code to permit it to work with a new paradigm, but in the process the LLM came up with an entire new feature that didn't exist beforehand _during_ what should have just been moving some code around.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Me and my coworker first thought it was just some weird code, until we realized what it was doing, and both came to the conclusion that the idea it implemented was worthwhile to keep.

</div>
Ben's patterns in the blog post / landing page are dope though, the LLM cooked.

[Sean Goedecke - To avoid being replaced by LLMs, do what they can't](https://www.seangoedecke.com/what-llms-cant-do/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> It’s a strange time to be a software engineer. Large language models are very good at writing code and rapidly getting better. Multiple multi-billion dollar attempts are currently being made to develop a pure-AI software engineer. The rough strategy - put a reasoning model in a loop with tools - is well-known and (in my view) seems likely to work. What should we software engineers do to prepare for what’s coming down the line?

Some great points from Sean, I'm of the same (biased) mind that what I have to bring to the table _alongside_ a LLM will stay relevant.
