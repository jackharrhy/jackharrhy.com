[ChromeDevTools/vite-plugin-devtools-json - Vite plugin for generating `com.chrome.devtools.json` on the fly in the devserver](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/vite-plugin-devtools-json)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
New pesky dev tools frustration from Chrome looking for `/.well-known/appspecific/com.chrome.devtools.json`...

I get the [proposal](https://goo.gle/devtools-json-design), but... _muh development console logs_.

At least there is a plugin that sets this up though, as the proposal itself mentions Vite by name.

A great read from Evan! SDL3's GPU API is quite nice to work with, and thankfully I didn't fall into the trap of _ooh lets do threads_ with [my last project using it](https://github.com/fogo-sh/arctic-char).

[Matt Palmer - *Insufficient Row Level Security policies in Lovable Apps*](https://mattpalmer.io/posts/CVE-2025-48757/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
A cheeky 'CVE' from a 'DevRel & Product' person, which does... seem to be real? I'm not saying the 'findings' in this post aren't real, and this didn't go through the usual _disclosure / acknowledgement / resolution steps, but I'd say its in the best interest of Replit to point at a competitor and say _ha vibe coded RLS rules!_.

Not saying I'm _for_ Lovable here, I just don't really see how Replit can wave much of a flag of _we do things correct_, I am very sure you can vibe code something just as bashable on their systems.

> Thomas Ptacek's frustrated tone throughout this piece perfectly captures how it feels sometimes to be an experienced programmer trying to argue that "LLMs are actually really useful" in many corners …

Simon Willison's dissection of Thomas' piece.

> Some of the smartest people I know share a bone-deep belief that AI is a fad — the next iteration of NFT mania. I’ve been reluctant to push back on them, because, well, they’re smarter than me. But their arguments are unserious, and worth confronting. Extraordinarily talented people are doing work that LLMs already do better, out of spite. [...]

As much as I think AI critique is extremely valid, I do hold a similar opinion that if you think its just a 'blip', you truly don't know what it is.

Are the marketing teams pushing claims that we're "mere steps away from AGI", _we're not_, but we've discovered something extremely interesting that we're still learning to wield properly.

[Mendhak - edit is a terminal text editor that doesn't make me think](https://code.mendhak.com/microsoft-edit-cli-text-editor/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> My terminal-based text editing almost always occurs in short sessions. I’ll usually want to modify something and get out. To me, it makes no sense to have to step on a learning curve for a text editor. A good tool gets out of your way, which is why I don’t tend to favour `vim`, and only tolerate `nano`.

> Recently, [edit](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/edit-is-now-open-source/) was open-sourced, and by chance I spotted that it had a [Linux build](https://github.com/microsoft/edit/releases), so I decided to try it out.

Edit looks really nice and simple.

I'm a Vim enjoyer, but this does look like a much better more powerful nano.

SwiftCrossUI provides your users with a native experience on every platform via a suite of backends built on top of various UI frameworks (see [Backends](https://stackotter.github.io/swift-cross-ui/documentation/swiftcrossui/#backends)).

I've been looking around for a good option for building a truly _native_ feeling cross platform application, not using something like Electron

[Slang](https://shader-slang.org/) is dope, having more examples of it alongside popular tutorials seems great for its adoption!
