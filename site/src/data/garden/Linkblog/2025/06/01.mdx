[/u/Major_Wheat on /r/newfoundland - Strange art across St. John's. Does anyone know what these are? : r/newfoundland](https://www.reddit.com/r/newfoundland/s/QzsVuYDBur)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
There is a large amount of Bart Simpson-esq graffiti across my city, St. John's, and /u/Major_Wheat has documented a considerable amount.

I found a bart in the wild, circa March 2024:

My friend [Ethan](https://ecrann.dev/) nabbed a pretty epic picture of one the other day:

[r/logseq - Feat/DB is merged with Master](https://www.reddit.com/r/logseq/s/HNwz2PpIXb)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> The devs have just merged the feat/bd branch with the master branch. I now seriously hope that Logseq can get back to winning ways as it has a lot of great stuff going for it, but feel like it derailed itself in the past year or so.

Logseq has been cooking on a database version for a _while_, its really nice to see the extremely long lived branch finally take over the master branch!

I'm still likely going to stay on pre-DB for a while, since its the work horse I'm currently typing this link blog in, and I have a feeling my existing large graph won't just port super easy... but when I have time, I will make the switch, and hopefully it will pay off.

[Dan Abramov - RSC for LISP Developers](https://overreacted.io/rsc-for-lisp-developers/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
Another day, another Dan React Server Components post.

> One of the big ideas of LISP is that code is data, and data is code. I mean, that’s kind of [generally](https://wiki.c2.com/?DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing) true, but in LISP it’s both culturally and syntactically emphasized.

This is another analogy-heavy post, but this time pandering to the functional / lisp crowd.

> React Server Components (RSC) is a client-server programming paradigm that uses a similar idea to refer to client code from the server code. The 'use client' directive lets you import code designed for the client—but without running it:
>
> ```jsx
> 'use client'
>
> export function onClick() {
>   alert('Hi.');
> }
> ```
>
> Like quoting, it marks a piece of code to be treated as data. Unlike quoting in LISP, the result you get back is opaque—you can’t transform or introspect that code.
