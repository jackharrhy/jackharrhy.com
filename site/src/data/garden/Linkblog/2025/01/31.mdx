[The commoditization of AI](https://yieldcode.blog/post/the-commoditization-of-ai/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> In the 1990s, there was a tech revolution called “The Internet”. [...] One of the companies that caught this trend of “the internet” was Cisco, [...] it’s price reached $82 per stock, putting it at a total market cap of $536B. This was the highest stock price, and market cap, that Cisco has ever reached. It stayed there for a year, until crashing back to $15 per stock on March 2001. Today, it’s stock trades at around $60, and its market cap is about $230B. What caused this fast climb and sharp decline, you might ask?

> You see, the entire AI tech bubble is built on the assumption that doing AI is hard, and it requires billions of dollars of investments.

> Just like with the internet, AI is going to transform. From being tightly controlled by a group of tech people to be run on expensive hardware, to being freely available and run on consumer grade hardware.

[Hedge fund Elliott warns White House is inflating crypto bubble that ‘could wreak havoc’](https://archive.ph/JxNPr#selection-1745.0-1745.88)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> The Trump administration’s embrace of cryptocurrencies is helping fuel a speculative mania that could cause “havoc” when prices collapse, the hedge fund Elliott Management has warned.

You mean the guy that launched a pump and dump crypto coin scheme of himself, followed by his wife, is making decisions that are less than ideal for the future of crypto?

Who would've guessed...

[Standard Schema - A common interface for TypeScript validation libraries](https://standardschema.dev/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> The goal is to make it easier for ecosystem tools to accept user-defined type validators, without needing to write custom logic or adapters for each supported library. And since Standard Schema is a specification, they can do so with no additional runtime dependencies. Integrate once, validate anywhere.
