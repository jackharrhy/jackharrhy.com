_vc funding will save the python ecosystem_

I'm really glad Astral exists, to be honest, `ruff` is epic, `uv` is spectacular, and I really hope this will continue the streak.

It would be great if FastAPI / SQLAlchemy / `<insert other big projects here>` will have good support for this out of the box, I would expect this to be the case given how a lot of the selling point of `ruff` was its ability to just be flake8 / black / etc. rules but _fast_ because _RIIR_.

Currently I find Python type checking more bother than its worth, but I also do look at Python as a do it quick / do it once / do it for yourself sort of language, If I want strictness I'm going either TypeScript or Rust.
