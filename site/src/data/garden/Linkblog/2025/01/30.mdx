[How I Use AI: Meet My Promptly Hired Model Intern](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2025/1/30/how-i-ai/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> I treat AI as I would a collaborator or a pretty good intern but I remain responsible for the final outcome. In this case the intern also happens to get better month by month as models improve. And a bit like a human, that digital intern has morals and wants to be argued with. Except, of course, that some of those AI interns [don't want to talk about China](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/187oidh/deepseek_coder_7b_33b_thinks_its_trained_by_openai/), while others get a stroke [if you talk about certain people](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1h3rz4l/david_mayer_is_not_the_only_one_jonathan_zittrain/). But regardless of how good they get, in the end, it's my fault and my fault alone if I do the wrong thing. I won't blame the AI and I need to spot check.

> ... My approach isn't about outsourcing thinking, but augmenting it: using LLMs to accelerate grunt work, untangle mental knots, and prototype ideas faster. Skepticism is healthy, but dismissing AI outright risks missing its potential as a multiplier for those willing to engage critically.

I look up to folk like Armin who have contributed a ton of useful tools to open source over the years, hearing the same sort of feelings towards AI from him is nice.

Skill atrophy is still a concern, I would hope that I could still perform at a decently high level if the LLM was pulled from my IDE, but I do really think that the productivity boost you get from using tools like Cursor cannot be understated.

> OpenAI says it has found evidence that Chinese artificial intelligence start-up DeepSeek used the US company’s proprietary models to train its own open-source competitor, as concerns grow over a potential breach of intellectual property.

The company that scrapes the entire web, is unhappy at another entity scraping them, boo-hoo.

This seems nice, I'm not really a huge Bluesky user, but I'd be down to figure out how to make content I post here autopost in some form to platforms.

_Including_ Twitter, if it didn't require getting nuclear level access codes to grab an API key these days.

Getting links to my stuff on the feeds of others would be cool, the idea of other people ending up on my webpage, going _cool_, and either making note of it or subscribing to my (eventual) RSS feeds, feels nice.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
I used kaboom.js for a gamejam previously, was sad to see that get deprecated, but happy that a community managed fork seems to be popping off.

The overall website is a big improvement over the original project, which is good for selling it as something that means business even if it gives the vibes of a toy engine.
