[Tomasz Czajęcki - Handmade pathfinding mesh for games](https://tchayen.com/handmade-pathfinding-mesh-for-games)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> Last year I posted about how I implemented Sloan's Fast CDT (Constrained Delaunay Triangulation) from a computer science paper. I used it for experiments with pathfinding but the system I achieved wouldn't scale. It would only be able to take a list of points and constraints and turn it into triangulation mesh, all at once or nothing. This wouldn't be suitable for dynamic pathfinding systems where obstacles are created and removed.

Triangulation based pathfinding mesh generation, very neat.

I've heard a lot of chatter about the Eight Sleep, both how its a life changer, and also how its really expensive and can be replaced with a much cheaper DIY setup, but now, that _it contains AWS keys_.

The authors also dig into this:

> What goes too far in my opinion, is [the Eight Sleep firmware] allowing all of Eight Sleep’s engineers to remotely SSH into every customer’s bed and run arbitrary code that bypasses all forms of formal code review process.

_Yikes_.

_This prompt_, was accessible via the Windsurf binary, for some time.

Supposedly it was easy as running:

A Windsurf engineer responded to this online saying:

Crazy for that to be in a production bundle nonetheless.

I tested this on my own system:

[I Went To SQL Injection Court](https://sockpuppet.org/blog/2025/02/09/fixing-illinois-foia/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> Should public bodies in Illinois, like cities and school districts and sheriff’s departments, be allowed to hide information from Freedom of Information requests by keeping them in databases? That question is before the 104th Illinois General Assembly, thanks to a bill sponsored by Donald P. DeWitte, elected state senator by the wise citizens of Batavia and Elgin (motto: “The City In The Suburbs”; indeed), and prompted in part by my friend Matt Chapman.

The gist of the legal 'battle' mentioned in this post, is if an entity has to respond to FOIA requests (specifically Illinois in this article), and that entity has a database, to expedite getting data out of that entity, it should be able to share its database schema, so you can just ask it to run arbitrary SQL against a public body, without a general request sans query hitting a public body, where it has to fall through potentially multiple hands before it boils down into a query, then a response to you, which could take weeks.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> It’s hard to come up with ideas. I feel this viscerally. I often ask myself the question what’s next? but rarely in those moments do ideas come. I have never been able to force ideas to come. Instead, it is after a conversation with friends, reading a thoughtful essay or a good book, or seeing something out in the world when I finally feel that spark of creativity after which the motivation to make something new follows. From learning about something new, or seeing something from a new perspective, I feel inspired.

This is also my hope, honestly these linkblogs are almost just me staring posts in my feed reader, more useful for me than maybe for others, and forcing myself to come back to them later to write about them.

I need more than just the link blog, hopefully I can go the James route and have more and more nooks and crannies in my website!

I remember back to the days of Vice doing North Korea specials, it felt like there were videos like this sprouting up quite often, but as mentioned in the video, since the lockdown, western tourists getting to visit North Korea, well, basically haven't.

Other than that, the video is what you would expect, its North Korea.

[Damien - Modding Balatro on PC to add touch controls](https://damien.zone/modding-balatro-on-pc-to-add-touch-controls/)

> *TL;DR: I've made a Balatro mod that adds the touch controls of the iOS version on PC. It's called "Sticky Fingers" and is available to [download on GitHub](https://github.com/eramdam/sticky-fingers)! This post will is mostly about the process of making the mod itself.*

The way the author went about this is also quite neat:

> If you are unaware, Balatro is a game written using the [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) framework in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and more importantly… the code of the game is available on the file system when you buy it! All of it, neither obfuscated nor minified! This is, obviously, very convenient when it comes to making mods ([of which there are many](https://github.com/jie65535/awesome-balatro)), and it greatly simplified what I wanted to do.

Even before the mobile version was released, it was possible to extract the underlying Lua files and just run it via Love 2D directly on Android, I had friends playing it well before the official release date on all sorts of devices.
