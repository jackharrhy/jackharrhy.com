[sokol](https://github.com/floooh/sokol) has compute shaders now! very cool!

I don't have a project in mind to make use of it yet, but I really want to try it out sometime.

Matt discusses two projects, [WinDurango](https://github.com/WinDurango/WinDurango) (open source), and [XWine1](https://x.com/XWineOne) (not open source yet), both making strides to getting Xbox One games running on regular Windows.

One of the interesting reasons people are interested in doing this, is that [Minecraft: Xbox One Edition](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Xbox_One_Edition), might be one of the best bets to get a non-bedrock 'legacy' console version of Minecraft running natively on PC.

I personally don't have nostalgia for it, but know many who do.
