Upcoming Odin game jam!

Although I'm currently in the midst of a jam, working on [this project](https://github.com/fogo-sh/arctic-char/tree/main), I'm planning on taking part in this one as well.

> I failed math in highschool because I played too much World of Warcraft

Respect.

> ...for me, I tried to understand what the code is doing, and every time I have to step into the Unreal Code, I just felt, a terrible dread, just like, you're in one inheritance level, and there's like five things above and below you, and we just have to inject somewhere in-between...

The abstractions of large engines are good, but it does seem like if you need to dip your head into them, you can quickly get lost.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Thankfully with Godot its arguably less complex than other engines, and obviously open to check out and even contribute, but still _complex_ nonetheless.

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

At the end of the interview, Karl has some wisdom about ensuring that if you do embark on a project, such as a game, in the sort of realm he has (low level programming), and you start to build something like an engine, _make sure you stay on track for the features you need for your task at hand_, don't get stuck adding stuff you think a engine simply needs, add features that _your_ game needs.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
As someone making a game in Odin/SDL3, and planning on making something for the upcoming Odin jam, this is good advice.

I honestly would love this sort of thing, I had a chat with ChatGPT voice mode on my way home from work the other day, and had an entire chat about Quake 1 BSPs in the context of integrating them into a game engine, there honestly isn't really a human I can call to have this conversation with, honestly if there was I would much rather talk to a person, but sometimes I just want to spit ball ideas at an AI using conversation rather than text.

However, you can still tell the AI is _trying_ to sound more question-responey, not exactly a natural conversation partner, Matt is onto something with this _road trip_ idea.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> What I’d really like to share with you more than anything else is my sense of wonder at the storage systems that are all collectively being built at this point in time, because they are pretty amazing. In this post, I want to cover a few of the interesting nuances of building something like S3, and the lessons learned and sometimes surprising observations from my time in S3.

S3 is such a ubiquitous protocol, and obviously Amazon's offering of S3 the _service_ is the most popular of implementations of said protocol (as it would be given it was created _for_ said service).

I'm one who's of the mind that things like [Bun S3](https://bun.sh/docs/api/s3) have extreme merit to exist as language / runtime level features.

This article is as much about the history of storage devices as much as its about S3, a good read.

[Facundo Olano - Gleam, coming from Erlang](https://olano.dev/blog/gleam-coming-from-erlang/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> I recently took some time to try [Gleam](https://gleam.run/), the type-safe language that runs on the Erlang virtual machine. For a couple of weeks, I used it to build a little [open-source](https://github.com/facundoolano/news.olano.dev/) feed aggregator that’s now [live](https://news.olano.dev/). These are my notes.

I've yet to give Gleam a solid go, mostly because when I look into [Gleam's OTP story](https://github.com/gleam-lang/otp), I expect it to be similar to [Elixir's GenServer](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/GenServer.html), which as far as I know, is only syntax sugar ontop of Erlang's [gen_server](https://www.erlang.org/docs/24/man/gen_server).

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
This probably is just a conceptual skill level on my side, I just am not sure if my existing knowledge I've gained from reading through [Elixir in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/elixir-in-action-third-edition) would come into play with Gleam.

</div>
This seems to be shared sentiment between myself and Facundo:

> OTP in Gleam is what took me the most effort to figure out. The [hexdocs](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_otp/index.html) cover the basics but that wasn’t enough for me to get the concepts right, especially where they differed from their Erlang counterparts. For that, I reached out to [this GitHub project](https://github.com/bcpeinhardt/learn_otp_with_gleam), its tests and those of the [gleam/otp](https://github.com/gleam-lang/otp) repo, and the Gleam Discord history.
>
> [...]
>
> Unlike the rest of the language, the OTP abstractions haven’t stabilized yet. In other words, gleam_otp hasn’t reached 1.0.

Honestly reading this makes me feel validated in some ways, and also willing to wait out when I intend to use Gleam in the future...

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

The author actually published a [project](https://news.olano.dev/) from this adventure into Gleam, always nice someone to give a language a go by building a non-trivial application in it, rather than critiquing it from a hello world / factorial.
