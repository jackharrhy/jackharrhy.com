[Chris Coyier - Google Being Forced To Sell Chrome is Not Good for the Web](https://chriscoyier.net/2025/03/14/google-being-forced-to-sell-chrome-is-not-good-for-the-web/)

I do wish there was some benevolent entity that could inherit Chrome and do well with it...

But I feel like I agree with Chris here, while Google is no perfect caretaker of the web, I'm of the mind they are doing an honest effort to push whats possible in such a way that doesn't result in them being the only player in the field.

EdgeHTML being replaced with Chromium, is in my opinion, more of a failure / change of focus from Microsoft's perspective than it is proof Chrome is 'taking over'.

> BlenderMCP connects Blender to Claude AI through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing Claude to directly interact with and control Blender. This integration enables prompt assisted 3D modeling, scene creation, and manipulation.

[MCP](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) integration into Blender, very nice!

This is my favorite web development tutorial on the internet, its always my go-to thing to leak to other web developers, even seasoned ones, to give them a proper introduction / reintroduction to CSS Flexbox.

Its foodie illustrations are both fun and quite good as well.

Must read for anyone who's ever used `display: flex;`, in my opinion.

[Maya.land - an RSS bot in a group chat is our era's best salon](https://maya.land/responses/2025/03/14/blogs-plus-groupchats-salon.html)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> I’m on a Discord server where every time we post a blog post it gets posted in the channel. That’s nice. Often there’s a nice chat! I bet there will be once I post this one. I want to set it up for other Discords I’m in. Not to post Official Updates on The Thing the Discord server is about… but just to let everyone see the blogs everyone else is writing. Get excited about it! Respond to each other at length!

This sounds really nice! I would love to get a lil' bot setup which you can throw a RSS/Atom feed, or even a OPML chunk at, and have post into a threads-only channel.
