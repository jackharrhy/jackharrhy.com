[Nelson Elhage - Performance of the Python 3.14 tail-call interpreter](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/cpython-tail-call/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> About a month ago, the CPython project merged [a new implementation strategy](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-tail-call) for their bytecode interpreter. The initial headline results [were very impressive](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/128718), showing a 10-15% performance improvement **on average** across [a wide range of benchmarks](https://pyperformance.readthedocs.io/) across a variety of platforms.
>
> Unfortunately, as I will document in this post, these impressive performance gains turned out to be **primarily due to inadvertently working around a regression in LLVM 19.** When benchmarked against a better baseline (such GCC, clang-18, or LLVM 19 with certain tuning flags), the performance gain drops to 1-5% or so depending on the exact setup.

I hope to never reach the point in my software career where a _regression in LLVM_ affects the performance characteristics of the software I'm working on...

[Jared Sumner - Bun v1.2.5](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.2.5)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> This release fixes 75 bugs (addressing 162 👍), and adds +69 passing Node.js tests. It includes improvements to the frontend dev server, CSS modules support, a full rewrite of Node-API, faster `Sign`, `Verify`, `Hash`, `Hmac` from `node:crypto`, and bug fixes for `node:net` and Bun's bundler.

The Bun team continues to put in the work for _extreme_ Node compatibility.

This was an instant cop for me.

The TypeScript compiler is being ported to Go!

Dogfooding is obviously important, however I think this is a great choice.

Ahhhh! Why exclusive to a device I have no current intent in owning myself _why_!
