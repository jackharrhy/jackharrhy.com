[kernel.org - FUSE-over-io-uring design documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/filesystems/fuse-io-uring.html)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
FUSE supports [`io_uring`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_uring), very cool.

I know there is some overhead to using FUSE that makes it less than ideal for proper filesystem use cases, but I would assume something like `io_uring` closes the gap of performance a bit due to its design.

I saw this on QEMU's Google Summer of Code 2025 asks, in which they're looking for someone to ["Extend QEMU's FUSE export type with FUSE-over-io_uring support"](https://wiki.qemu.org/Google_Summer_of_Code_2025), very cool.

The words "Corporate Espionage" are not used lightly here, this is some movie level nonsense.

> According to the lawsuit, Deel’s spy spent over four months obsessively and systematically accessing Slack channels where he had no legitimate business interest. He searched Slack more than 6,000 times – allegedly swiping confidential sales pipeline data and internal customer interactions.

The 'spy' was a Slack-a-holic, nice.

Looks like C might be getting the `defer` keyword, sick!

[calebccff/6502.sh - A 6502 emulator written in busybox ash](https://codeberg.org/calebccff/6502.sh)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> 6502.sh is a fully-functional 6502 emulator and debugger written in [busybox ash](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ash) compliant shell script, using only a handful of busybox tools.
>
> ## [](https://codeberg.org/calebccff/6502.sh#features) Features
>
> 6502.sh has a whopping 32k of RAM and 16k ROM in its default configuration, however this can be easily adjusted by editing [`machine.sh`](https://codeberg.org/machine.sh).
>
> It includes an interactive debugger with single-stepping, breakpoints (break on code, data access, JSR/RTS), and more. See [#Debugger](https://codeberg.org/calebccff/6502.sh#debugger) for detailed instructions.

Saw this on [Mastodon](https://social.treehouse.systems/@cas/114171610700263367), very cursed, but very amazing.

[FTEQW Quake engine](https://www.fteqw.org/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Very cool Quake source port that's basically at this point its own game engine.

I managed to get it building on Mac! Doesn't look like finding Mac binaries of this is super trivial, I might host them on this site somewhere.

If I end up _not_ doing that, but you run across this on your own interweb journey, shoot me an email!
