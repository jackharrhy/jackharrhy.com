[Simon Willison - Here’s how I use LLMs to help me write code](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/)

Simon's coverage of LLMs, but also contributors, such as the great [`llm`](https://github.com/simonw/llm) CLI tool, have been both plentiful and consistently posted / updated.

Usually his web blog is posting other peoples snippets, which I can say nothing ill about as the writer of this link blog which is _just_ that at the moment, but today we're treated to a full sized Simon himself post!

Here are some of my favorite points brought up in his post:

> **Set reasonable expectations**

> Ignore the “AGI” hype—LLMs are still fancy autocomplete. All they do is predict a sequence of tokens—but it turns out writing code is mostly about stringing tokens together in the right order, so they can be *extremely* useful for this provided you point them in the right direction.

[microsoft/typescript-go - Why Go? #411](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go/discussions/411)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> Language choice is always a hot topic! We extensively evaluated many language options, both recently and in prior investigations. We also considered hybrid approaches where certain components could be written in a native language, while keeping core typechecking algorithms in JavaScript. We wrote multiple prototypes experimenting with different data representations in different languages, and did deep investigations into the approaches used by existing native TypeScript parsers like swc, oxc, and esbuild. To be clear, *many languages would be suitable in a ground-up rewrite situation*. Go did the best when considering multiple criteria that are particular to this situation, and it's worth explaining a few of them.

A lot of armchair expert programmers shouting _why not Rust, Rust fast Rust fast why not C#, C# fast C# fast_.

Understand these folks really did consider their options for this, rewrites are _not_ done lightly.

While I am a functional enjoyer, I think other languages / paradigms are better for gamedev personally.

_But_, it is always nice to see people who do make this technical choice not just write a fnacy medium post, or build an advanced ECS engine, without actually _shipping_ anything.

Here, Alex has not only _shipped_, but shipped something that doesn't look like a university undergraduates final semester gamedev project they were required to make for marks without any love (which it seems that's the bulk of these 'look I made a game using lambda calculus wow):

[Jack Hopkins - Factorio Learning Environment](https://jackhopkins.github.io/factorio-learning-environment/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly saturating existing benchmarks, necessitating new open-ended evaluations. We introduce the **Factorio Learning Environment (FLE)**, based on the game of Factorio, that tests agents in long-term planning, program synthesis, and resource optimization.

Who needs to play Factorio when an LLM can do it for you?

A lot of discussion on the memory layout of structs, and approaches you can take to better optimize for modern day CPUs.

He references ['Andre Weissflog's - Handles are the better pointers'](https://floooh.github.io/2018/06/17/handles-vs-pointers.html) article, which I've heard reference to in the [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/) circles I've been hanging around (Andrew actually does reference Odin in this talk funny enough).

He also references [this graphic](http://ithare.com/infographics-operation-costs-in-cpu-clock-cycles/):

Notice the x scale, its _logarithmic_, the difference between a L1 read, a L3 read, and a Main RAM read, is quite visual here.

One thing brought up in his talk, is that sometimes, memoization of an expression that needs math to compute, might just be cheaper to recompute when you need it than store, since yes you'd save the computation, but only potentially wrecked by an expensive memory read.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> TL;DR: The DuckDB team and MotherDuck are excited to announce the release of a local UI for DuckDB shipped as part of the `ui` extension.

DuckDB is shipping with a UI! This is really nice.

Such a great tool, a piece of technology like this shipping with a GUI view on top of it is great too, no need to potentially export this into some other tool to extract insights from it, just do `duckdb -ui`.

[Anna’s Blog - Winners of the $10,000 ISBN visualization bounty](https://annas-archive.org/blog/all-isbns-winners.html)

> A few months ago we announced a [$10,000 bounty](https://annas-archive.org/blog/all-isbns.html) to make the best possible visualization of our data showing the ISBN space. We emphasized showing which files we have/haven’t archived already, and we later a dataset describing how many libraries hold ISBNs (a measure of rarity).

Very cool competition, check out the first place!:

> "everything is a file" but as a game development environment. top-level virtual filesystem, where VM (lua) scripts are the equivalent of userland processes and device drivers are files to read and write data from. maybe there's a dedicated protocol for such, like 9P. so you can send typed data across pipes to and from engine components, as well as device and input drivers. or something, idunno.

Very interesting concept.
