Today is a _YouTube_ heavy day.

I've heard mention of [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/) from certain circles as of late, specifically [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/).

It was [him who posted about this video](https://bsky.app/profile/danabra.mov/post/3likwqwvlns27).

The opening of this video about it was enough to hook me for a bit, but then the latter bit flew right over my head.

But I can't _not_ put it here, the channel has way too little subscribers, need to pump this content!

The PS1 boot logo is a 3D model!

Its similar to the [`pop.lmp`](https://github.com/id-Software/Quake/blob/bf4ac424ce754894ac8f1dae6a3981954bc9852d/QW/client/common.c#L62) file in Quake, in the way that the system will validate that the data contained on the CD is the same value as / matches the hash of something on the system, but the value / data itself is copyrighted, so the idea was (at least at the time in the late 90s), since the system (or in the case of Quake, the game) would not boot without the required data, if a bootleg / copy / rip was created, by it simply having this copyrighted thing inside, would be the thing they would _get you_ on from a legal perspective.

I believe this has since been basically proven not legally binding, but it seems like this was commonplace back in the day.

The N64 was a console that didn't _require_ sorting your polygons before giving them to the GPU, it has a [hardware-based approach](https://www.copetti.org/writings/consoles/nintendo-64/) to [Z-buffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering).

Fireflake though, figured out a way to _remove_ that Z-Buffer, and leave the game as is.

It runs just fine, but it a much more visually 'interesting' experience.
