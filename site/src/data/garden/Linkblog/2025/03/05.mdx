[Fabien Sanglard - Why FastDoom is fast](https://fabiensanglard.net/fastdoom/index.html)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Fabien discusses [FastDoom](https://github.com/viti95/FastDoom/), a Doom port that aims to modify the game as little as possible from a feature set / graphics perspective, but instead aims to boot performance on older systems, the ones Doom was designed to run on in the first place.

As with other Fabien artciles, great read.

Great, not just an AI summary at the top of Google search, but an entire page!

I will likely be driving my beautiful 2012 Toyta Matrix into the ground, not because of increased car prices, but because its a vehicle that goes from point A `->` B and doesn't guzzle gas.

But poor folk that want newer vehicles...

My own bookshelf is close to an antilibrary, I have a feeling with Maggie she's the type to have actual read a lot... I for sure read a ton of small form content (see how much I post on this linkblog), but I honestly

I kinda like this, the amount of money I've seen companies spend on CI is... a bit much.

Thankfully, my current job as well considers developers having highly specced laptops a _priority_, so I could most def. be a CI runner.

However, we do rely on [merge queues](https://graphite.dev/docs/graphite-merge-queue), something I assume this approach would not jive with.

Basecamp has made [some](https://basecamp.com/cloud-exit) [interesting](https://kamal-deploy.org/) [choices](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0) as of late to rely on the cloud less and less, which I support.

They however, have also made some other [technical choices I disagree with quite heavily](https://world.hey.com/dhh/you-can-t-get-faster-than-no-build-7a44131c), and [socially](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406673/basecamp-political-speech-policy-controversy) not have a clean slate as well.

Their [book](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) is kinda good though... at least the good bits.

_One million pounds_, from a _bug_.

Nice.
