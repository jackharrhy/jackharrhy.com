[Mishaal Rahman - Exclusive: Google will develop the Android OS fully in private, and here's why](https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/)

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
> TL;DR
>
> Google has confirmed to¬†*Android Authority*¬†that development of the Android operating system will soon fully happen in private.
>
> Currently, Google shares some of the work it does on the public AOSP Gerrit, but moving forward, this work will all be done in private.
>
> The goal for this privatization is to simplify Android OS development and not to hinder external developers, which is why Google remains committed to publishing source code to AOSP after each release.

I'm not close enough to this space to know if this will actually affect anything.

> This change will also have minimal impact on most developers. App developers are unaffected, as it pertains only to platform development. Platform developers, including those who¬†[build custom ROMs](https://www.androidauthority.com/build-custom-android-rom-720453/), will largely also see little change, since they typically base their work on specific tags or release branches, not the main AOSP branch. Similarly, companies that release forked AOSP products rarely use the main AOSP branch due to its inherent instability.

This is hopefully the case.

But still, building in open is cool.

This is really cool to see!

MCP reaching OpenAI was something I hoped to see when the spec first came out, even though Anthropic were the ones to plant the seeds, seeing OpenAI start to adopt it is _nice_.

> Can I sum up Macaroons in a short paragraph? Macaroon tokens are bearer tokens (like JWTs) that use a cute chained-HMAC construction that allows an end-user to take any existing token they have and scope it down, all on their own. You can minimize your token before every API operation so that you‚Äôre only ever transmitting the least amount of privilege needed for what you‚Äôre actually doing, even if the token you were issued was an admin token. And they have a user-serviceable plug-in interface!¬†[You‚Äôll have to read the earlier post to learn more about that](https://fly.io/blog/macaroons-escalated-quickly/).

I've never needed to reach for Macaroons for applications I've built, but I really like the idea of them.

Feels like [pledge](https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2) for JWTs.
