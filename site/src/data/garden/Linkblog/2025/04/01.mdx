I'm a SDL enjoyer, and also a JavaScript enjoyer, this is a _cool_ project.

My only real question is, is it possible to _package_ this into a self-contained binary, similar to what [Tailwind does with their standalone CLI](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli).

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Looks like [`pkg` by Vercel](https://github.com/vercel/pkg), what they mention in the article, is deprecated, _but_, [Node 21 has something _built in_ for this?](https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html), cool.

Saw mention of this project on the [Bun v1.2.8 release notes](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.2.8).

Blog rolls are cool, Robert's approach here to create a 'blog roll' network built from a starting point, as well as showing the references between sites, is _very_ cool.

I need to get my own `/blogroll` setup, having the same sort of [network map](https://alexsci.com/rss-blogroll-network/) as Robert would also be dope.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Biiiig NPM outage, for a period of time, all of the above packages could not be resolved.

[This very website wasn't able to build via GitHub actions due to this bug](https://github.com/jackharrhy/jackharrhy.com/actions/runs/14200435095/job/39785817342).

All praise Guido.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Very extensive list of game engines!

I however can't `ctrl-f` for Quake, would love to have a similar list for all Quake-engine based things.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
I am cooking up my own link of [[Quake]] things on my own site though... if you check it out as it currently stands it likely isn't formatted very good and is a bit of a chaotic cluster, but I intend on fixing that up and having a really good collection of everything Quake, mostly on the technical / engine level!

Maybe I can contribute back content to this list one day.
