This sort of tech would have been dope for the [Open Pit](https://www.openpit.net/) events.

[Sean Goedecke - Senior engineers should make side bets](https://www.seangoedecke.com/side-bets/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> When you’re a junior, you should work on what you’re given.

> ...

> However, senior engineers should not only work on what they’re given. There are also two reasons for this. First, if a senior engineer spends all their time working from a list of tasks (GitHub issues, JIRA tickets, and so on), they’re likely to miss the [work that’s actually important](https://www.seangoedecke.com/party-tricks). Second, senior engineers should spend 10-20% of their time making *side bets*.
>
> What is a side bet? It’s a project or task that you think will be valuable to the company, but that isn’t on anyone else’s radar. It could be a new feature, or a performance optimization, or a change that will speed up development - as long as it could provide a concrete benefit.

I'm glad to be part of a company that encourages ones _side bets_, its for sure a bit risky obviously to go off of the beaten project managed path and just _build something_, but I think people would be surprised what sort of things can be thrown together by a competent developer which could change the game within a company.

I also though, think that just randomly throwing a week long / couple day hackathon, is _great_, but is _not_ that '10-20% of their time' amount.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> I’m interested in consuming information in order to create new information (one of my motivations for pursuing a Ph.D.). I generally read articles/papers or watch videos, and then create papers/articles/code and have discussions as a result.

I am in the same boat, as per this link blog!

Ryan's setup however is _quite_ busy, involving both Obsidian & Zotero, with a lot of scripts to sync things between devices and such.

Very nice.

[Vicki Niu - How Discord Indexes Trillions of Messages](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-indexes-trillions-of-messages)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> Back in 2017, we shared how we built our message search system to[index billions of messages](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-indexes-billions-of-messages). ... We chose to use Elasticsearch, with Discord messages sharded over[indices](https://www.elastic.co/blog/what-is-an-elasticsearch-index), the logical namespace for Elasticsearch messages, on two Elasticsearch clusters.
>
> But as Discord grew, our search infrastructure began to exhibit a few cracks…

Vicki covers the _interesting_ issues Discord ran into running ElasticSearch at _massive_ scale.

The TL:DR; is moving to the [Elastic Kubernetes Operator](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/deploy/cloud-on-k8s), and running a _"larger number of smaller Elasticsearch clusters"_.

A feature that spawned out of this refactor is actually quite nice:

> This is what powers the new cross-DM search functionality, now available on mobile. Now, all DM messages and search queries are served by the `user-dm-messages` Elasticsearch cell, and guild messages and queries served by `guild-messages` cell.

Also, special consideration was given to _BFGs_:

> As guilds on Discord grow larger with longer histories, more and more of them bump up against Lucene’s MAX_DOC limit of ~2 billion messages. We needed a solution to scale search for these special cases, which we call BFGs, or Big Freaking Guilds.

_Big freaking guilds, lol_.

> Now, with our new search infrastructure, we:
> - Index **trillions of messages,** with **double the indexing throughput** of our legacy search
> - Improved median query latency from 500ms to \<100ms, and p99 from 1s to \<500ms
> - Run **40 Elasticsearch clusters** with **thousands of indices**
> - Perform cluster upgrades and rolling restarts automatically and with no service impact

Wow, big data.

> Today [Melissa Lewis over on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/melissa.news/post/3ln7hx5rhcj2v) pointed out that the font used in the infamous "You wouldn't steal a car" anti-piracy campaign was actually designed by Just van Rossum, whose brother, Guido, created the Python programming language.
>
> She also pointed out that the font had been cloned and released illegally for free under the name "XBAND Rough". Naturally, it would be hilarious if the anti-piracy campaign actually turned out to have used this pirated font, so I went sleuthing and quickly [found a PDF from the campaign site](https://web.archive.org/web/20051223202935/http://www.piracyisacrime.com:80/press/pdfs/150605_8PP_brochure.pdf) with the font embedded.

> So I chucked it into FontForge and yep, turns out the campaign used a pirated font the entire time!

_You wouldn't pirate a font_.

(But we might)

[oscarotero/ssx - Fast and simple server-side JSX library](https://github.com/oscarotero/ssx)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> SSX is a minimal JSX library designed to be used ONLY in server side and output plain HTML code.

I was looking for a really simple way to do some HTML on the server, and while I've used things like Handlebars / Jade before, I _wanted_ JSX.

This, seems to be a nice version of just that:

```jsx
import { renderComponent } from "@lumeland/ssx/jsx-runtime";

function ComponentA() {
  return <div>Hello</div>;
}

function ComponentB() {
  return (
    <span>
      <ComponentA />
    </span>
  );
}

const rendered = await renderComponent(<ComponentB />);
console.log(rendered);
```

_Nice_.
