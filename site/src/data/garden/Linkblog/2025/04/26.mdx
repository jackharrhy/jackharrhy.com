Voyager 1 is flaking out, but folks like David are the _goats_ pulling dark magic to 'debug' it, under these [challenges](https://youtu.be/YcUycQoz0zg?t=2396):

> **Challenges**
>
> - JPL designed processor with custom instruction set
>   - A document that may or may not be accurate
> - No source code files
>   - Source code listing in Microsoft Word with errors
>   - May or may not match the version on the spacecraft
> - No assembler
> - No simulator
> - No testbed
> - Telemetry must be restored as soon as possible!!!
>   - No visibility into an aging and delicate spacecraft
> - AND: We were unable to find 256 contiguous words of memory that were unused!

And sometimes I can't figure out where padding is coming from on my `div`s, we both have it rough.

Evals seem to be the best way to wrangle and understand your LLM workflows, but also _so full of fluff_.

I'd like to know exactly how I'd integrate them into my work, but honestly I have no idea where I'd even start.

> 1. Evolve to qualitative the quantiative

Feature flags are chefs-kiss.
