Eddy's videos are a great watch, from [eating at every Rainforest Cafe in the US](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vA-bjpKvIw8), to [ghost kitchens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkIkymh5Ayg), and as of recent on his channel with his brother, [covering the 2000s "spy kid" craze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz0Szo1UKRE).

This latest piece of content of his though, he goes a month without using his cell phone, both to see if it finds him [doomscrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) less, and also if he can still live a life / organize hangouts with his friends / etc.

I've personally uninstalled Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, and as of not long ago, YouTube itself (due to shorts), since I find I am a massive hunk of metal that is magnetized to algorithmic short form vertical video slop screens.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
I would pay _money_ to have a YouTube app w/out shorts, no shorts on home screen, no shorts button, just give me long form content.

My saving graces are [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) for RSS, and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), and while I have many feeds, and am starting to follow lots on Bluesky, with Miniflux I can get to inbox zero with Miniflux, and Bluesky defaults to a chronological list of posts, so eventually I'll scroll to a section thats a familiar, and I _close the app_.

Its not that I don't _want_ to use social media, I just want applications that aren't running A/B tests to min-max my screen time.

[Thomas Dohmke - Vibe coding with GitHub Copilot: Agent mode and MCP support rolling out to all VS Code users](https://github.blog/news-insights/product-news/github-copilot-agent-mode-activated/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
As always, Microsoft is lagging behind and taking features Cursor already has and back-porting them to VSCode / Copilot.

> In keeping with our commitment to offer multi-model choice, we’re making Anthropic Claude 3.5, 3.7 Sonnet, 3.7 Sonnet Thinking, Google Gemini 2.0 Flash, and OpenAI o3-mini generally available via premium requests, included in all paid Copilot tiers.

Also... Now _any_ request that hits Claude / Gemini is a 'premium' request?

Not sure if that was the case before, and it was just locked behind configuration, but as far as I know, ~~that isn't the case for Cursor.~~

Actually [it is](https://docs.cursor.com/settings/models), "500 fast premium requests per month", so if you pay for Pro and stay under the threshold, you wouldn't see the usage.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
3.7 is considered premium, but so is 3.5... I would have assumed at least 3.5 would be non-free, but I guess that isn't the case.

</div>
My work pays for Cursor... and I be vibe coding using my work account, so sorry `$dayjob` if my personal project vibe coding is racking up the company Cursor bill, but I will continue to use it unless told otherwise.

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

So maybe Copilot is copying Cursor on pricing as well then, ha.

New Casey Neistat video!, his upload schedule has lessened a lot over the last year, which honestly I am here for, I find when he has a break this long, he sometimes just randomly starts to become a daily poster again.

His review of the Switch 2 is so... candid, he speaks to MKBHD who's [review is the exact style you'd expect from him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3CR6RiWS2U), while Casey is just kinda... there hanging out.

More LLM news more LLM news.

Scout, Maverick, and _Behemoth_.

> These models are our best yet thanks to distillation from Llama 4 Behemoth, a 288 billion active parameter model with 16 experts that is our most powerful yet and among the world’s smartest LLMs. Llama 4 Behemoth outperforms GPT-4.5, Claude Sonnet 3.7, and Gemini 2.0 Pro on several STEM benchmarks. Llama 4 Behemoth is still training, and we’re excited to share more details about it even while it’s still in flight.

This also seems cool on paper, but there's some [news coming out that these benchmarks might be a bit misleading](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/06/metas-benchmarks-for-its-new-ai-models-are-a-bit-misleading/).

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Due to the open source nature of Llama, you can [already run it on Groq](https://groq.com/llama-4-now-live-on-groq-build-fast-at-the-lowest-cost-without-compromise/).

This will likely make the Llama models the most cost-effective, as it will be a race to the bottom from different providers, competition in who _hosts_ rather than companies like OpenAI / Anthropic being the holders to the keys of their models, while I am not fan of Meta, I am a fan of their approach.

As much as I am a LLM user and somewhat enjoyer, I would actually like to see them get destroyed in court over this.
