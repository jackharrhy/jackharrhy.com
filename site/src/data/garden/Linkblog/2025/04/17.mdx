[Markwhen - A markdown-like journal language](https://markwhen.com/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> A markdown-like journal language for plainly writing logs, gantt charts ,  ... ,  todos, timelines, calendars or anything that happens over time.

Simple writing format:

```md
2025-04-09: Single date
2025-01-22 / 2026-10-24: Date range

Dec 1 2025: Supports multiple date formats
And longer descriptions
```

Neat output:

I like this.

[Rob Shearer - Mastodon Exit Interview](https://v.cx/2025/04/mastodon-exit-interview)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> I am currently winding down [the Mastodon bots I used to post sunrise and sunset times](https://v.cx/2024/02/solar-bot). The precipitating event is that the admin of the instance hosting the associated accounts demanded they be made nigh-undiscoverable, but the underlying cause is that it’s become increasing clear that Mastodon isn’t, and won’t ever be, a good platform for “asynchronous ephemeral notifications of any kind”. I’d also argue (more controversially) that [it’s simply not good infrastructure for social networking of any kind](https://bsky.app/profile/r.v.cx/post/3kldku4rh2s2k).

Rob has a pretty scathing review of Mastodon, and I think I... really agree with the points he's making here.

This honestly sucks as the ideas of ActivityPub, and the folks behind Mastodon, are not _bad_, its just... from the perspective of a user, Mastodon is simply lacking.

> Mastodon simply doesn’t show users the posts they ask to see ...
>
> The most immediate problem is that you only have access to posts that are present on your local instance, and posts are only propagated to your local instance if it has expressed interest in them (to the instance where they originate). It’s a chicken-or-egg issue: how do you know whether you’re interested in something if you can’t see it?

I used to have an account on a now-defunct instance myself and [Tim Oram](https://github.com/mitmaro) ran, on the domain `nfld.social`, the Mastodon experience on that server was... tiny, I did put in the work to run scripts to find people I followed on Twitter on the instance, and found a few cool Gamedev / GIS lists to follow, but Mastodon on that server never felt really connected at all.

I check Bluesky _much_ more than I check my Mastodon account, but... I do check Twitter 10x more than either :(

[Michael Harley responded](https://michaelharley.net/posts/2025/04/17/re-mastodon-exit-interview/) to Rob's post, and agrees.

> I attempted to run my own single-user instance for a while and I was bumping into discoverability/federation issues. I followed and used hashtags, like \#HomeAssistant, because I want to participate in discussions about Home Assistant. But because of how federation works, I was not seeing all posts tagged with \#HomeAssistant, nor do I feel my own posts tagged as such were being seen by all the others following the same hashtag.

And also makes the _great_ point:

> Can you imagine having to run your own email server if you wanted to send/receive emails at your vanity domain?

I'm [`@jackharrhy.dev‬`](https://bsky.app/profile/jackharrhy.dev) over on Bluesky no problem, just had to validate I owned the domain.

[Alex Kretzschmar - How Tailscale Grows Up Without Selling Out](https://tailscale.com/blog/founder-interview-c)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> In this fireside chat, CEO Avery Pennarun and CSO David Carney join Alex from the Tailscale team to reflect on the company’s journey so far, our recent Series C raise, and what comes next as we scale; without losing sight of what makes Tailscale, Tailscale.

I'd really like if Tailscale didn't go down the route of [enshitification](https://doflo.com/blog/what-is-enshitification-and-can-we-stop-it), so obviously seeing that very term in this article sparks some joy.

Lets see what time will tell.

This is a laugh, vibe-codes support responses are... a take.

If Cursor can't pull them off... maybe don't do this.

Its not just the AI companies though, there was a [similar story with Air Canada](https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisagarcia/2024/02/19/what-air-canada-lost-in-remarkable-lying-ai-chatbot-case/).

Big money.

I'm a Cursor enjoyer, but this would be interesting to see.

[Vlad A. Ionescu - A message about Earthly](https://earthly.dev/blog/shutting-down-earthfiles-cloud/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> - In the next three months, we will be phasing out our Earthly Satellite commercial services, including the Earthly Cloud Satellites, Self-Hosted Satellites, and BYOC Satellites, together with their respective free tiers. We are also phasing out Earthly Cloud Secrets and Logs.
> - We are also ending active maintenance of the Earthly open-source project.
> - We are supporting the community’s efforts to self-organize a fork, and we encourage those interested to get involved.

And this, this is sad.

I know my friend [Riley](https://rileyflynn.me/) used Earthly, and I considered looking into it before, but obviously now I'm glad I didn't.
