[modelcontextprotocol/specification - [RFC] Replace HTTP+SSE with new "Streamable HTTP" transport](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/206)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> This PR introduces the Streamable HTTP transport for MCP, addressing key limitations of the current HTTP+SSE transport while maintaining its advantages.
> Our deep appreciation to [@atesgoral](https://github.com/atesgoral) and [@topherbullock](https://github.com/topherbullock) (Shopify),
> [@samuelcolvin](https://github.com/samuelcolvin) and [@Kludex](https://github.com/Kludex) (Pydantic), [@calclavia](https://github.com/calclavia), Cloudflare, LangChain, Vercel, the Anthropic team, and many others in the MCP community for their thoughts and input! This proposal was only possible thanks to the valuable feedback received in [the GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/discussions/102).

Been looking into MCP stuff as of late, and was honestly pretty disappointed to see how developer focused it is.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
I mean, I _am_ a developer, so obviously cool, but I'm trying to think of the user-facing things that could be built with this, which currently does not seem to be the focus on the MCP world (as it _currently_ stands).

Seems to be a good solution to an aspect [the post critical of MCP I brought up the other day](/linkblog/2025/03/23)

[ohsome-planet: Convert OSM data to GeoParquet](https://latlong.blog/2025/04/ohsome-planet-convert-osm-data-to-geoparquet.html)

> The good folks at [Heigit](https://heigit.org/) have released [ohsome-planet](https://github.com/GIScience/ohsome-planet), a handy tool to turn OpenStreetMap history data from [PBF](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PBF_Format) into GeoParquet files, ready to use in common GIS applications.

[GeoParquet](https://geoparquet.org/) sparks joy, this is a cool tool.

[Karl Zylinski - Generate Odin bindings for C libraries](https://zylinski.se/posts/generate-odin-bindings-for-c-libraries/)

Another great tool for the Odin community from Karl.

I don't have a library I can think of running through this at the minute, mostly because the [vendor library collection](https://pkg.odin-lang.org/vendor/) is already _stacked_.

I'd love for [JoltPhysics](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) to get a _good_ set of Odin bindings, but alas, C++.

[Markdown and the Slow Fade of the Formatting Fetish](https://ia.net/topics/markdown-and-the-slow-fade-of-the-formatting-fetish)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> Year after year, document formats like `.docx`, `.ppt`, and `pdf` lose a little bit of steam. You might not have noticed… But Markdown is growing over and into the old formats, slowly, and nicely, like moss on a stranded star destroyer. Notes on a revolution in slow motion.

This site is a [sea of .mdx files](https://github.com/jackharrhy/jackharrhy.com/tree/61de7f762294b77f8fc788314c3cd8b2b4514001/site/src/data/garden), so obviously I am biased, but I agree with this premise of this article.

> From online tools to native apps, from GitHub to Slack to ChatGPT, bit by bit Markdown is taking over. It’s not a big deal. Hardly anyone has heard the word Markdown. But awareness has increased significantly, especially among younger professionals, students, and AI tool users. Increasingly, it shapes the way we format and share ideas. And that’s fantastic news.

I never really thought of ChatGPT as being something introducing Markdown to the masses, but I guess it really does introduce folks to the syntax even if they're not aware.

A nice writeup, and a _very well made website_, with prose from Bill Gates on the early days of Microsoft.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
And while its well made / aesthetic, it seems to get the cool _ascii_ glitchy text, there is no ability to select text, not very _accessible_ of you Bill.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
The folks over in the [Map Center](https://www.map-center.com/) Discord were discussing using an old version of [OBLIGE](https://oblige.sourceforge.net/) that supports generating maps for Quake / Quake II.

Looks like there's a more modern version of this that's still supported!

No Quake support... maybe a potential project in my future?

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
Probably not, my list of projects grows faster than I can chew away at them.

This link blog is also currently a big time hog... mostly due to my own fault of collecting links and not writing these entries, until I have no real choice to sit down and just crank out 10+ of them in one / a few sittings.
