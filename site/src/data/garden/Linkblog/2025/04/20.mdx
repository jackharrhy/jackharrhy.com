[Erin Catto - Box2D 3.1](https://box2d.org/posts/2025/04/box2d-3.1/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
[Box2D 3.0](https://box2d.org/posts/2024/08/releasing-box2d-3.0/) has been out since August of 2024, but 3.1 just dropped with what I think is a really neat feature: a _built-in_ character mover!

> I’ve added experimental character mover support to 3.1. This uses a *geometric solver*. It should be useful for games that want greater control than what you get with a dynamic or kinematic body.

Here's a video of it in action:

Nice to see Box2D getting some attention, it was pretty nice to use in [an Odin gamejam project](https://github.com/fogo-sh/arctic-char) I threw together not long ago.

> I’ve been a *very* happy [Synology](https://taoofmac.com/space/com/synology) customer for [over 15 years](https://taoofmac.com/space/blog/2020/04/04/2310), but this piece of news (which echoes [the Western Digital fracas from a couple of years ago](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/clearly-predatory-western-digital-sparks-panic-anger-for-age-shaming-hdds/?utm_source=taoofmac.com&utm_medium=web&utm_campaign=unsolicited_traffic&utm_content=external_link)) makes me wonder if I will keep recommending them.

Rui's post is referencing [this Ars Technica article](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/synology-confirms-need-for-synology-branded-drives-in-newer-plus-series-nas/), _"Synology confirms that higher-end NAS products will require its branded drives"_.

This _sucks_, I'm in the same boat, my 4-bay decently specced Synology NAS was not a cheap purchase, but I haven't had to do any considerable messing around with that thing, it has _so many_ features and _just works_, which is just what you want out of what holds all your important data.

But, I can't support / recommend a company who's going down this frustrating path of requiring their own drives for their own devices.
