Minecraft heavy linkblog time!

This URL is cursed, I assume I'm ontop of networking know-how until I run across this stuff.

The e164.arpa domain, is part of the [telephone number mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_number_mapping) system.

> **Telephone number mapping** is a system of unifying the international [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone) number system of the [public switched telephone network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network) with the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet) addressing and identification [name spaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_space). Internationally, telephone numbers are systematically organized by the [E.164](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) standard, while the Internet uses the [Domain Name System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) (DNS) for linking [domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_name) to [IP addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) and other resource information.

_Woah_.

There's [an entire listing](https://www.iana.org/domains/arpa) of all these `.arpa` domains.

[caukub - Minecraft Server Handbook](https://mcguide.caukub.dev/)

> This book is for *everyone*. It serves as a knowledge base for anyone who knows nothing about Minecraft servers, as well as for those who are interested and want to learn more about how they work in more depth.

I've been playing Minecraft for [a while](https://www.planetminecraft.com/skin/cheesemanys-cheesey-suit/), and for most of that time, have been running servers.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
Back in the day, [LogMeIn Hamachi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LogMeIn_Hamachi) was the workaround for not knowing how to port forward, _but_, there was also [portforward.com](https://portforward.com/), which I remember spending lots of time staring likely at [this page](https://portforward.com/actiontec/gt784wn/1-bell-aliant/) figuring out how to port forward 25565 on my FibreOP modem.

</div>
Honestly this was the start of learning system administration skills / the terminal / configuring a soup of `.yml` into something fun.

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

caukub's handbook seems to be a _wealth_ of knowledge.

For someone like myself, I skip past getting started, but even the ['platforms' page](https://mcguide.caukub.dev/general/platforms) is a really nice summary of all the forks and options and such running serverside software with plugins / mods / etc.

caukub didn't author [this graph](https://github.com/saboooor/fork-graph), but I've never seen it before:

<Image src='/asset/fork_graph_1753534978655_0.png' alt='fork_graph.png' width={2500} height={1875} />

There's sections on commonly used plugins as well, like web based maps with [Dynmap](https://mcguide.caukub.dev/plugins/specific/dynmap).

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
While looking at `pl3xmap`, referenced in the bottom of Dynmap's page, I just ran into [this site](https://map.roanv.nl/), which is a comparison between different map plugins, very cool!

Good man Mat, I've had a server griefed before by what I think might have been the infamous [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) group, nice to see someone is scanning the ipv4 space for servers and _not_ logging them into a Discord server for folks to join and blow them up.

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

There's a great [SalC1 video on a Mojang-Owned server being found and griefed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGULXMoBw6g), which makes me feel less dumb.

The sort of things server-side Minecraft plugins can do these days boggles the mind.

[Patbox - Polymer Patch for CC: Tweaked](https://github.com/PolymerPorts/cc-tweaked-patch)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> This is a patch for [CC: Tweaked](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-tweaked) (which by itself is fork/continuation of original ComputerCraft), that modifies it allowing nearly all functionality of regular version to work purely server side (Vanilla client can join servers using it and have all functionality!).

So... yeah, my last point about boggling the mind stands.

[Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) is a _"a library for creating server side content, that work for player's without mods or (required) resource packs!"_, made by Patbox.

There's an entire suite of bespoke mods by Pat, but also _ports_ of Fabric mods using his framework, including the mentioned _computer craft_ port.

[goldenstack - Days since last Rust Minecraft server](https://dayssincelastrustmcserver.com/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">

Minecraft server software written in Rust.

I too, one day, would like to contribute to the ever growing list of Minecraft protocol implementations, maybe in Rust, maybe not.

Of course someone has cooked up Minecraft server infra for k8s.

The name being Shulker is hilarious.
