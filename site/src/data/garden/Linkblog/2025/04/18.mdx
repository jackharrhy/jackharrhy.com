[ArkType: TypeScript's 1:1 validator, optimized from editor to runtime](https://arktype.io/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
An interesting alternative to Zod I've seen mentioned around the interwebs.

```js
const User = type({
	name: "string",
	platform: "'android' | 'ios'",
	"version?": "number | string"
})
```

Also this is a pretty big claim:

> 100x faster than Zod and 2,000x faster than Yup at runtime, with editor performance that will remind you how autocomplete is supposed to feel

_Gotta go fast._

[Ali Cheraghi - Zig and GPUs](https://alichraghi.github.io/blog/zig-gpu/)

> GPU programming used to mean wrangling C++ compilers, bloated SDKs, and vendor-specific toolchains. That’s changing. You can now write GPU code in modern languages like [Rust](https://rust-gpu.github.io/) and [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) with fewer layers. This post walks through the current state of Zig’s GPU backends and how they stack up across Vulkan, OpenCL, and native ISAs.

Zig to [SPIR-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Portable_Intermediate_Representation) is mentioned in this post, _very neat_.

I hope we live in the timeline that a language in this space, be is Zig, Odin, Jai, Rust, _whatever_ surpasses C++ as the king of this sort of thing.

For now though, all hail C with Classes.
