Very nice looking 'mapmaking tool', [Canvas of Kings](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2498570/Canvas_of_Kings/) in action.

The ability to move underlying grids around so sections are lined up, but misaligned from the 'world' grid as you the player sees fit.

This is a nice palette.

> In early 2022, when we counted our ARR at PlanGo, my co-founder and I shared a moment that we couldn't believe. We just crossed the magical €1M ARR milestone, something that felt unreal for a company built on one Rails codebase and one developer (me).

Bram chronicles building a startup with Rails back in 2011, which opens quite interestingly:

> To kickstart PlanGo, my co-founder had this brilliant marketing idea: offer our software completely free for the first year to anyone who signed up during launch week. We expected maybe a few dozen curious users would take us up on the offer.
>
> **We got 500 signups in the first week.**

That's crazy! Getting to that many users quickly seems like no easy feat, I assume this was a different world back in 2011 to now, but those early users must have been gold.

> Around the end of 2022, something unexpected happened. A foreign investor approached us, interested in PlanGo. By that time, we'd grown beyond €1M ARR, all bootstrapped and profitable. No outside funding, no massive team, just a lean operation powered by Rails.

What a position to be in, very cool.

Brendon shows some amazing in-dev sketches of Skin Deep, my favourite being the first one from 2015:

I wish the 'time until next fart' made it into retail...
