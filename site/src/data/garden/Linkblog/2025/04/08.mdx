[Tim Bergeron - Quake 1 Web Tools](https://q1tools.github.io/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
Nice selection of misc. tools by [Tim Bergeron](https://github.com/timbergeron) for doing cool Quake 1 stuff.

A tool to do some basic edits to items in a BSP:

Even a BSP to SVG tool, I tried it with some Quake II stuff, to no avail, but a LibreQuake map (`lqdm1.bsp` to be exact) worked just fine:

Tim also seems to be behind [Quake Spasm Spiked Multiplayer, QSS-M](https://qssm.quakeone.com/).

I'm still adding more content to [[Quake]], but its very much still not pretty.
