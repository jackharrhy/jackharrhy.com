[Crux - Cross-platform app development in Rust](https://redbadger.github.io/crux/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> Crux is a framework for building cross-platform applications with better testability, higher code and behavior reuse, better safety, security, and more joy from better tools.
>
> It splits the application into two distinct parts, a Core built in Rust, which drives as much of the business logic as possible, and a Shell, built in the platform native language (Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript), which provides all interfaces with the external world, including the human user, and acts as a platform on which the core runs.

One of my recent interests in programming adventures has been building a cross-platform core for an application, but relying on native UI on the operating system window end.

Very much inspired by Ghostty, which has a Zig core, with a really nice SwiftUI frontend for MacOS, and GTK for Linux, as covered in [Mitchell Hashimoto's blog here](https://mitchellh.com/writing/zig-and-swiftui).

Crux is neat, it allows targeting web platforms and mobile, if it also did desktop GUI I would have likely dug deep into it, sadly not exactly what I've been looking for, but still really cool.

Found out about Crux from: [A 2025 Survey of Rust GUI Libraries](https://www.boringcactus.com/2025/04/13/2025-survey-of-rust-gui-libraries.html)

Honestly a pretty cool resource, lots of code examples / screenshots / etc.

Target triples are sort of self explanatory (well, if each of the triples arent' `unknown`, as in `wasm32-unknown-unknown`), but Miguel explains in detail the history and who-says-what on triples, quite the dive.

CEO of [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) posting about their company getting asked by Figma to stop using the term 'dev mode' in their project...

More details on [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/15/figma-sent-a-cease-and-desist-letter-to-lovable-over-the-term-dev-mode/), this is just silly.

Came across this on Twitter, gives huge [Teleglitch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/234390/Teleglitch_Die_More_Edition/) vibes to me, loved that game.
