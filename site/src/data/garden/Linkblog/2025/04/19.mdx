[lichendust/lena - A handmade framework for making tiny games](https://github.com/lichendust/lena/tree/main)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> Lena is a compact, handmade framework for making tiny games with palette graphics. It's software-rendered, cross-platform and provides artistic constraints that challenge your creativity without limiting your game's size and scope.

Really neat little Odin-native game tool, able to target Windows, macOS, Linux, & WASM.

```odin
main :: proc() {
	lena.init("Hello, Lena!", 128, 128, flags = {.HIDE_WINDOW, .HIDE_CURSOR})
	defer lena.destroy()

	lena.set_window_background(BLUE)
    ...
```

Cute API.

Lena's creator posted a short little example on [their Mastodon](https://sunny.garden/@lichendust/114361134270501887):
