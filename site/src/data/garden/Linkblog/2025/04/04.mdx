[@animejs.com‬ - After 5 years in the making, I'm very happy to finally release Anime.js v4](https://bsky.app/profile/animejs.com/post/3llw7xuybwc2x)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
New [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) release!

[FWGS/xash3d-fwgs - Xash3D FWGS engine](https://github.com/FWGS/xash3d-fwgs)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> Xash3D ([pronounced](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=ks%C9%91%CA%82) `[ksɑʂ]`) FWGS is a game engine, aimed to provide compatibility with Half-Life Engine and extend it, as well as to give game developers well known workflow.

[Alan over on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/wizardzone.net/post/3l2zcxmzvuk2f) is working on a [cool project](https://bsky.app/profile/wizardzone.net/post/3lm3p5awkxs25) using Xash3D.

The textures / _vibe_ made me sort of think it was Quake/GoldSrc based, but honestly I wasn't fully sure until I saw it posted by Alan _in_ the [Map Center](https://www.map-center.com/) Discord!

Very cool.

[Tom MacWright - Personal Tools](https://macwright.com/2025/04/03/personal-tools.html)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> I used to make little applications just for myself. Sixteen years ago (oof) I wrote a [habit tracking application](https://github.com/tmcw/habiter), and a [keylogger](https://macwright.com/2012/02/15/minute) that let me keep track of when I was using a computer, and generate some pretty charts.
>
> I’ve taken a *long* break from those kinds of things. I love my hobbies, but they’ve drifted toward the non-technical, and the idea of keeping a server online for a *fun project* is unappealing (which is something that I hope [Val Town](https://www.val.town/), where I work, fixes). Some folks maintain whole ‘homelab’ setups and run Kubernetes in their basement. Not me, at least for now.

> But I have been tiptoeing back into some little custom tools that only I use, with a focus on just my own computing experience. Here’s a quick tour.

Tom has many nice tools.

I want to get more on the small tool train.

[Antonio G. Di Benedetto - We asked camera companies why their RAW formats are all different and confusing](https://www.theverge.com/tech/640119/camera-raw-spec-format-explained-adobe-dng-canon-nikon-sony-fujifilm)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> When you set up a new camera, or even go to take a picture on some smartphones, you’re presented with a key choice: JPG or RAW?
>
> JPGs are ready to post just about anywhere, while RAWs yield an unfinished file filled with extra data that allows for much richer post-processing. That option for a RAW file (and even the generic name, RAW) has been standardized across the camera industry — but despite that, the camera world has never actually settled on one standardized RAW format.

While I would be pro-standardization in this space, I do feel like its not as easy as just _adopting_ the spec for these camera manufacturers, with regards to how their existing systems and even _hardware_ are built around their own formats.

I think this will stay a problem to be solved in _software_, as a [Lightroom Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Lightroom) user, my software makes the RAW format invisible to me, which I'm a fan of.
