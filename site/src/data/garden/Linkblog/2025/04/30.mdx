Jason was working on an unrelated project, but realized he had the tooling to scrape all of Hacker News.

Produced out of that was this graph of mentions of keywords over time:

Neat.

> We’ve been working on BitCraft for over 7 years, and with early access on the horizon, we’re making a decision that we hope will set the tone for the future of the game: we’re open sourcing the code.

I've been following the development of BitCraft, mostly from the perspective of it being built on the already open source [SpacetimeDB](https://spacetimedb.com/), nice to see BitCraft itself also being open sourced!

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> When I started building **Architect of Ruin** in December 2023 I chose to build it in the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine. My choice was motivated by a personal interest in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) -- a language I derive a lot of joy in using. [...]

Brandon covers all of the pros of using Bevy, but then the large lot of _cons_.

He mentions this conversation between himself and his partner:

This honestly sums up the article quite well.

I don't think its constructive to hate on Rust for its complexity, I think certain fields utilize it quite well, like a heavy utilized well optimizable HTTP endpoint, or a encryption algorithm.

But a _game_, still at the _prototype_ phase? I've seen too much in the way of this simply being a bad idea for productivity and actually shipping a game.

Similar vibes as to [LogLog Games' "Leaving Rust gamedev after 3 years"](https://loglog.games/blog/leaving-rust-gamedev/).

[Lauren Tan and Mofei Zhang - React Compiler RC](https://react.dev/blog/2025/04/21/react-compiler-rc)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> The React team is excited to share new updates:
> - We’re publishing React Compiler RC today, in preparation of the compiler’s stable release.
> - We’re merging `eslint-plugin-react-compiler` into `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`.
> - We’ve added support for swc and are working with oxc to support Babel-free builds.

React compiler release candidate! Extremely hype!

Planning on getting this into our repo at work _asap_.
