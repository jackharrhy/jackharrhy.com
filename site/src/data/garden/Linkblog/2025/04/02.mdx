[Michael Larabel - Intel Posts New Linux Kernel Patches To "Hide The Disgusting Turds"](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Intel-Patches-Hide-Turds)

> No, it's not at all an April Fools' Joke or anything along those lines... An Intel open-source engineer just posted the patch series entitled "hide the disgusting turds" for the Linux kernel.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> Nowadays, makefiles are ubiquitous in software. Most C and C++ projects have used them historically, and still use them as a build system. Nowadays, lots of projects written in other languages which have their own build tools also use them, not to make files, but to store and run commands in an organized manner. If this is you, you are doing it wrong. However, there is a tool designed to do just that:¬†`just`.

I'm a [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just) enjoyer.

I would however like to learn how to make cross-platform Justfiles, as I end up usually having to add cursed syntax them to make it work on both Windows and Mac/Linux, which most of the time doesn't even really end up working.

Honestly, [Bun Shell](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/shell) might be the play here, but I don't like the idea of telling people to install an entire runtime just to run scripts, but then, I might assume folks would have `bun` installed on their computer, rather than just having `just` installed through some method.

> **Lua should be considered a toolkit**

> I think it was Hisham who in¬†[his talk in LuaConf 2017](https://hisham.hm/papers/talks/hisham-lap-luaconf2017.pdf)¬†said that Lua is minimalistic (aka:¬†*‚Äúthere are zero ways to do it‚Äù*). This was of course about Lua offering mechanisms over policies, or how it unlocks agency in the developer by letting them adapt the language to suit their environment and not vice versa. Lua should be viewed as a base ingredient to which you add whatever you want. If you are making fruit smoothies, Lua is the milk and you add whatever fruits you need.

You are in control. [...]

Some great points from Andre in this post.

> MURRAY HILL, NJ ‚Äî Tailscale, the leading provider of effortless, private networking for modern distributed computing, today announced support for¬†[Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs)‚Ñ¢ from Bell Labs‚Ñ¢, the operating system redefining how networks, resources, and computation are managed. With Tailscale‚Äôs cutting-edge peer-to-peer networking capabilities now seamlessly integrated into Plan 9‚Äôs file-centric world, users can securely connect their machines across the globe as if they were on the same local network‚Äîwith zero manual configuration.

A funny April 1st post, but its [actually not a joke](https://tailscale.com/blog/plan9-port), there is really a [merged PR](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/pull/15491) into tailscale to flesh out the plan9 port of Tailscale.

_Brilliant_, [Plan 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs) is _so_ cool, its on my list of operating systems to try out on a machine for more than just a toy use case someday, however I'd probably pick [9front](https://9front.org/) or something else, since the last official release was [more than 10 years ago](https://web.archive.org/web/20170601074943/http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9checksums.txt).

The section on ["Design Concepts"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs#Design_concepts) on Wikipedia is a really good read.

Toby is a poor business man because I would pay full price for each one individually.

Thank you Toby Fox.
