Amos is [open sourcing](https://github.com/bearcove/home) the software they've been using to author their _amazing_ [website](https://fasterthanli.me/).

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Amos made a great [YouTube short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/hjkg6OLZ1GU) covering the CMS as well:

    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
></iframe>

I'd like my own infrastructure _maybe_ one day to be less Logseq bound, but I don't think I'd want to fallback to editing Markdown in a editor / IDE, I do like the psuedo-WYSIWYG nature of Logseq quite a bit.

Wii as a web server, what a dope piece of homelab technology.

I currently don't have a Wii in my possession, honestly I should change that and pull a classic [LetterBomb](https://please.hackmii.com/) to do my own cursed Wii shenanigans.

There's even a [status page](https://blog.infected.systems/status/) at the moment as well, displaying this:

[Wesley Moore - Building a Website Fit for 1999](https://www.wezm.net/v2/posts/2025/website-fit-for-1999/)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> Over the last week I’ve had a *lot* of fun building a little [retro-themed website](http://home.wezm.net/~wmoore/) that I’m hosting at home. Inspired by [Ruben’s Retro Corner](http://retro.rubenerd.com/) I’ve been meaning to do this for a while, and actually started on it in June last year. More recently Joel Humphries shared on [The Sizzle](https://thesizzle.com.au/) forum that he’d built [a little site](https://joelhumphries.com.au/) that he was hosting at home on a Raspberry Pi. This reignited my interest in getting my own site up again. For the fun of it I decided to implement it in [HTML4](https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/cover.html) and serve it over plain HTTP so that it would work on old computers.

What a fun project, it is very cool to see what I'd consider a more _modern_ designed website on a _much_ older browser.

I assume if my site is loaded up on older system, even if it _could_ access it via HTTP (I have [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) redirecting all HTTP traffic to HTTPS), it would probably still croak.
