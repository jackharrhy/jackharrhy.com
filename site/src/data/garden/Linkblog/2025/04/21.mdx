[Cathode Ray Dude - making a website is hard](https://blog.cathoderaydude.com/doku.php?id=blog:making_a_website_is_hard)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> i wrote like 8,000 words about how much i hate trying to make websites in the modern world and got so mad and disgusted that i just abandoned it. then i tried to write something nicer and that didn't work either. the best i can manage is not being outright vitriolic

I recently dove into looking around for the very tooling CRD is also looking for here, and came to the same understanding, that you have the two options he states:

> 1. hypercorporation offering you a Web App designed to generate one of 8 possible site...

And:

> 2. Computer People who say “just use a static site generator. all you have to do is SSH into your server (you DO carry the same laptop with you everywhere, right?) and type up everything in markdown

Now... I am _very_ much in the second camp, but mostly because a lot of folks I interact with are the technical / learning to be technical type, however I do have some friends who while they are clever, they don't have the programming chops or the time to learn them, so I'd _really_ like to have something for them to use.

I've thought about making my Logseq rube goldberg machine that's used for this website into something for more than just myself, but I don't know if I'm the type to champion being the saviour in this situation.
