React Server Components in React Router framework mode! Super hype!

I'm most excited for the basic use case of returning JSX from loaders like so:
```jsx
export async function loader({ params }) {
  let { contentBlocks, ...product } = await getProduct(params.productId);
  return {
    product,
    content: (
      <div>
        {contentBlocks.map((block) => {
          switch (block.type) {
            case "image":
              return <ImageBlock {...block} />;
            case "gallery":
              return <GalleryBlock {...block} />;
            case "video":
              return <VideoBlock {...block} />;
            case "text":
              return <TextBlock {...block} />;
            case "markdown":
              return <MarkdownBlock {...block} />;
            default:
              throw new Error(`Unknown block type: ${block.type}`);
          }
        })}
      </div>
    ),
  };
}

export default function Article({ loaderData }) {
  return (
    <ProductLayout product={loaderData.product}>
      {loaderData.content}
    </ProductLayout>
  );
}
```

Being able to portal JSX from serverside to clientside is _nice_, honestly it makes the boundary between the two feel more explicit, and works for Suspense and such just fine as well.

They're cooking on this, lets hope for a soon and _stable_ release candidate / _release_.
