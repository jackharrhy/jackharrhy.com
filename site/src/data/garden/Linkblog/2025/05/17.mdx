A response to [_Just fucking use HTML_](https://justfuckingusehtml.com/), which I must admit, I do agree with.

Obviously as well, with some spicy language.

I've built sites with the intent of being as little or _no_ JavaScript as possible, with tools like [Templ](https://templ.guide/) to retain good serverside developer experience, and sprinkling in [htmx](https://htmx.org/) where sensible in some sites for added functionality you don't get out of `<a>` and `<form>` and such.

But... many sites are not just sites, they are _applications_.

React's own description of itself is _"the library for web and native user interfaces"_, for something static and lacking much in the way of an _interface_, plain HTML is king ([Astro](https://astro.build/) being my choice of tools to achieve this sort of site), but if you need bells and whistles and batteries... just choose React.

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

To speak to other frameworks like Svelte / Vue / Solid / etc. , I think it stands you can use those as well for sure, but, React is the big dog in this space, its hard not to be the default for most folks / companies.
