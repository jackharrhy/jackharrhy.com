> this past weekend, i spent a lot of time looking at plants. i took photos of real plants and uploaded them to [inaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) for the [city nature challenge](https://www.citynaturechallenge.org/), and i downloaded [3D models of plants](https://discmaster.textfiles.com/search?q=plant&family=poly&dedup=dedup&unsupported=false) and put them into [godot](https://godotengine.org/) for the [discmaster jam](https://itch.io/jam/discmaster-jam).

Wonderful collections of plants on an equally wonderful [website](https://ribo.zone/).
