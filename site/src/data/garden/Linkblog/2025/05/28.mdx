I just built a little 'house':

Not a single `<script>` tag was harmed in the creation of this 'house'.

This is quite the demo, go check it out.

> To do that, we need to own the full stack â€” without leaning on layers of abstraction we don't control. That means no critical dependencies, not even React. We're starting with a fork of Preact, a mature virtual DOM library already used heavily at Shopify, Google, and countless others.

The Remix folks are pulling Remix in a direction away from React!

An earlier version of this blog post _leaked_, and was worded a little more harsh than this version, but the same sentiment towards the state of the web and the complexity of React comes across.

I personally put trust in Ryan and Michael to deliver on their vision, I've copped a ticket to [_Remix Jam 2025_](https://remix.run/jam/2025), and will be hyped to hear them in-person sell me on their vision.

This also does _not_ mean the death of React Router, that is its own thing under its own branding, Remix v2 being merged into React Router v7 frees up Remix to _metamorphose_ into its own thing ðŸ¦‹.
