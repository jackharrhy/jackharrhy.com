[Goldec - Modern Source Engine Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECmK5AiTkn0)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
> Even in 2025, people are still making new games on the Source Engine and some of them are surprisingly good. In this video, I go over four modern Source games that caught my eye, from Vietnam-era shooters to surreal robot afterlives. Whether you're here for the nostalgia or the innovation, these are worth checking out.

I'm a source engine _enjoyer_, its really cool to see some somewhat _modern_ source engine games still being produced.

The most interesting in this collection to me is [Klaus Veen's Treason](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1786950/Klaus_Veens_Treason/), a standalone murder-type gamemode, which is actually mountable to be opened up and accessed as a mod via Garry's Mod.

[Noel Berry - Making Video Games in 2025 (without an engine)](https://noelberry.ca/posts/making_games_in_2025/)

> When I share stuff I'm working on, people frequently ask how I make games and are often surprised (and sometimes concerned?) when I tell them I don't use commercial game engines. There's an assumption around making games without a big tool like Unity or Unreal that you're out there hand writing your own assembly instruction by instruction.

Noel has truly [_shipped_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celeste_(video_game)), its hype to see quite a technical blog post from him.

> For the current game project, he's using his own framework built around SDL3 called [Foster](https://github.com/FosterFramework/Foster).

Another really neat thing Noel has changed about his setup:

> Finally, to wrap all this up ... I no longer use Windows to develop my games (aside from testing). I feel like this is in line with my general philosophy around using open source, cross-platform tools and libraries. I have found Windows [increasingly frustrating to work](https://www.howtogeek.com/739837/fyi-windows-11-home-will-require-a-microsoft-account-for-initial-setup/) with, their [business practices gross](https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft), and their OS generally lacking. I grew up using Windows, but I switched to Linux full time around 3 years ago. And frankly, for programming video games, I have not missed it at all. It just doesn't offer me anything I can't do faster and more elegantly than on Linux.

_Year of the Linux desktop?_
