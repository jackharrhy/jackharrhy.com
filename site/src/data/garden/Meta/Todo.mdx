Content here is likely to be removed as it is seen to, this is mostly just me thinking to myself about what I want to put here, how I want to go about it, and also all of the technical goodies.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Mostly, I want all the features with all the ergonomics.

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

[[Now]] should populate https://jackharrhy.dev/now/ , not via an API call from the website, but if there is an update to the page here, it should be able to push a commit to my website repo.

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

This garden could just be my website... if I migrate enough of my existing stuff here, and add the ability for my index page with all its stuff, the navbar, the projects page, etc., I'd just have my regular website but its a garden!

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
This would also mean I don't have to do the nonsense with migrating Now to the web repo, since it would just be the repo.

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

This thing should always be building, but I want a web interface for it so I can review updates before they go live.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
For example, I might not want certain pages to actually be public, since the Logseq graph that powers this is also where I have a lot of personal stuff I'd rather not on the public internet.

Also, if this place has an RSS feed, I'd be curious _when_ new updates would go out, or potentially see that something was updated when it was just a minor spelling change, therefore I wouldn't want an update.

</div>
Index pages, like the one one directory up here.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Maybe just defining something special in the page properties of Logseq?

Like a page property that defines it as a listings page, and the second block is expected to be a query, so it renders in Logseq showing what it will show, but then also renders as a listing on the web.

</div>
Breadcrumbs

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
If you're in a deeply nested spot, should `see / a nice / path / of / how / you / got / there`

</div>
RSS feeds for new posts / updates to posts.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
https://notes.billmill.org/ has this down _pat_, would like to have the similar system of a feed for everything, vs. a feed for specific things.

Note that RSS feeds for the first bit should be considered volatile, as in URLs might change / all content might refresh / things ill overall just change and break.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
This gives me time to figure out what exactly I'm doing and how I want things to work, without having to let the concrete set on my  work right away.

</div>
</div>
Make use of MDX components for indentations.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Indents currently are generated as `div`s in Python land, it would be nice if it was just a component like `<Indentation indent=""> ...`.

This means we keep anything design wise in the land of Astro.

</div>
More complex components.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
I'd like to be able to upgrade some babble bin posts to _real_ posts.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
If this becomes my actual website, the posts in the Garden can probably just be treated as _first class posts_.

</div>
If I do this however, I don't want a drop in the abilities I have, which means when I'm authoring things in Logseq, I still want the ability to do:

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Images / videos

<div class="ml-[calc(3*1rem)] mb-8">
Probably can just copy things from the logseq folder to a r2 bucket or something similar, probably not a good idea to git lfs this stuff...

</div>
3 split of images (like in my Metrobus blog post)

Code (I'm pretty sure I get that for free with Astro, lets try that out)

<div class="ml-[calc(3*1rem)] mb-8">
```js
import { cool } from "dude";

const doCool = () => {
  cool();
};
```

</div>
</div>
</div>
Migrating more of what I have had private in my graph for years, into the garden.
