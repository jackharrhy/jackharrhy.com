[[Now]] should populate https://jackharrhy.dev/now/ , not via an API call from the website, but if there is an update to the page here, it should be able to push a commit to my website repo.

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

This garden could just be my website... if I migrate enough of my existing stuff here, and add the ability for my index page with all its stuff, the navbar, the projects page, etc., I'd just have my regular website but its a garden!

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
This would also mean I don't have to do the nonsense with migrating Now to the web repo, since it would just be the repo.

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

This thing should always be building, but I want a web interface for it so I can review updates before they go live.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
For example, I might not want certain pages to actually be public, since the Logseq graph that powers this is also where I have a lot of personal stuff I'd rather not on the public internet.

Also, if this place has an RSS feed, I'd be curious _when_ new updates would go out, or potentially see that something was updated when it was just a minor spelling change, therefore I wouldn't want an update.

Index pages, like the one one directory up here.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Maybe just defining something special in the page properties of Logseq?

Like a page property that defines it as a listings page, and the second block is expected to be a query, so it renders in Logseq showing what it will show, but then also renders as a listing on the web.

Breadcrumbs

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
If you're in a deeply nested spot, should `see / a nice / path / of / how / you / got / there`

</div>
RSS feeds for new posts / updates to posts.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
https://notes.billmill.org/ has this down _pat_, would like to have the similar system of a feed for everything, vs. a feed for specific things.

</div>
Migrating more of what I have had private in my graph for years, into the garden.
