Content here is likely to be removed as it is seen to, this is mostly just me thinking to myself about what I want to put here, how I want to go about it, and also all of the technical goodies.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Mostly, I want all the features with all the ergonomics.

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Would be nice for `.mov` to be converted into `.mp4`, potentially a good tool that could run in the root of my `~/logseq` folder, and my made useful to other people.

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Support handling Logseq's YouTube embeds better, so we have consistent styling and don't have to just copy paste the embeds in.

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Things that other people are doing that are cool:

Switch to Astro's built in Image component.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Need to ensure everything has a width / height.

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Astro DB usage for a bunch of cool ideas.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Setup a libSQL server.

Logging what IPs hit my RSS endpoint, since I have visibility via goat counter for web usage, but no idea if I'm actually getting pinged by anyones readers.

The ability to place a Q&A section at the end of any page quickly, and store the response.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Build a system to allow my inbox to fill up.

</div>
Rate limiting for any of the above.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Little bit of Redis maybe? Could really help with if I actually get hammered.

Webmentions

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
[webmentions.rock](https://webmention.rocks/) looks great for ensuring my webmentions are good.

I think I want to just make webmentions but astrodb... that would be cool to make into maybe even a generic system.

There are implmentation-reports over here too: https://github.com/w3c/webmention/tree/main/web/implementation-reports

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Look into how [Jonny Barnes](https://jonnybarnes.uk/colophon) did his, since it seems its webmentions int he context of a personal site, not a full blown multi site intergration.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
I've known of [Aaron Parecki's website](https://aaronparecki.com/) for a while, would be great to find what works for my website and either use his stuff, or recreate aspects of it in my own world!

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

What if this was useful for more than just me?

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
I'm building all this stuff, some of it open, some of it not, maybe I look into [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) / other indieweb things.

If the entire site is SSR, then maybe the site becomes a bit more wordpress-esq.

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Maybe use monospace font instead of serif?

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Consider ((679cf243-998b-48e2-a963-f9ebf7573a64))

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Fediverse intergration.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
If I'm doing RSS, maybe fedi will just come for free?

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Spend some time looking at other peoples gardens, make a mood board of what I want.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
[Maggie Appleton has written about this](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), I've already given this a look, but maybe another read and looking at everything linked to here would be good!

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

My Babble bin writings that I like should just be migrated to [[Posts]]!

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
I can revise them into a writing style I like, from `being all in lower case` to Having Upper Case Letters And Periods At The End Of Sentences.

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

This thing should always be building, but I want a web interface for it so I can review updates before they go live.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
For example, I might not want certain pages to actually be public, since the Logseq graph that powers this is also where I have a lot of personal stuff I'd rather not on the public internet.

Also, if this place has an RSS feed, I'd be curious _when_ new updates would go out, or potentially see that something was updated when it was just a minor spelling change, therefore I wouldn't want an update.

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Index pages, like the one one directory up here.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Maybe just defining something special in the page properties of Logseq?

Like a page property that defines it as a listings page, and the second block is expected to be a query, so it renders in Logseq showing what it will show, but then also renders as a listing on the web.

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Breadcrumbs

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
If you're in a deeply nested spot, should `see / a nice / path / of / how / you / got / there`

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

RSS feeds for new posts / updates to posts.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
https://notes.billmill.org/ has this down _pat_, would like to have the similar system of a feed for everything, vs. a feed for specific things.

Note that RSS feeds for the first bit should be considered volatile, as in URLs might change / all content might refresh / things ill overall just change and break.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
This gives me time to figure out what exactly I'm doing and how I want things to work, without having to let the concrete set on my  work right away.

</div>

<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Migrating more of what I have had private in my graph for years, into the garden.
