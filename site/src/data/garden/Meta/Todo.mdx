Content here is likely to be removed as it is seen to, this is mostly just me thinking to myself about what I want to put here, how I want to go about it, and also all of the technical goodies.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
Mostly, I want all the features with all the ergonomics.

Cite element usage, https://heydonworks.com/article/the-cite-element/.

Would be nice for `.mov` to be converted into `.mp4`, potentially a good tool that could run in the root of my `~/logseq` folder, and my made useful to other people.

Astro DB usage for a bunch of cool ideas.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
Setup a libSQL server.

Logging what IPs hit my RSS endpoint, since I have visibility via goat counter for web usage, but no idea if I'm actually getting pinged by anyones readers.

Webmentions

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
[webmentions.rock](https://webmention.rocks/) looks great for ensuring my webmentions are good.

I think I want to just make webmentions but astrodb... that would be cool to make into maybe even a generic system.

There are implmentation-reports over here too: https://github.com/w3c/webmention/tree/main/web/implementation-reports

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
Look into how [Jonny Barnes](https://jonnybarnes.uk/colophon) did his, since it seems its webmentions int he context of a personal site, not a full blown multi site intergration.

[p3k](https://indieweb.org/p3k)

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
I've known of [Aaron Parecki's website](https://aaronparecki.com/) for a while, would be great to find what works for my website and either use his stuff, or recreate aspects of it in my own world!

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

What if this was useful for more than just me?

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
I'm building all this stuff, some of it open, some of it not, maybe I look into [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) / other indieweb things.

If the entire site is SSR, then maybe the site becomes a bit more wordpress-esq.

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Fediverse intergration, as in posting content from site `->` fedy.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
If I'm doing RSS, maybe fedi will just come for free?

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Spend some time looking at other peoples gardens, make a mood board of what I want.

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
[Maggie Appleton has written about this](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), I've already given this a look, but maybe another read and looking at everything linked to here would be good!

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

My Babble bin writings that I like should just be migrated to [[Posts]]!

<div class="ml-[2rem] mb-8">
I can revise them into a writing style I like, from `being all in lower case` to Having Upper Case Letters And Periods At The End Of Sentences.

</div>
<div class="w-full h-4"></div>

Migrating more of what I have had private in my graph for years, into the garden.
