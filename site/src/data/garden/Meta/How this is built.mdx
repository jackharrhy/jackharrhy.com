This site starts from a Logseq graph, its actually the Logseq graph I've been using since ~2022, but every page in that graph denoted with `public:: true` is part of this website.

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
![graph.png](/asset/graph_1738337031270_0.png)

_My graph as it stands as of Jan 31st, 2025_

</div>
I've written some Python that speaks to the Logseq HTTP API (basically the same API that is exposed to Logseq plugins, but accessible over a simple HTTP RPC interface).

This Python queries Logseq with a simple `(property public true)`, to get all of the pages for the site, and then gets each page using the `logseq.Editor.getPageBlocksTree` method against the HTTP API.

The structure returned by `getPageBlocksTree` is pretty nice to work with, I map over this structure, and in the most simple case, I simply take the `.content` property of a block, and add it to a string for each child of a block.

Where things get interested, is if the block has properties on it, such as this example from [[projects]]:

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
```
component:: Project
image:: <img src='/asset/_jaharrhy_1738274907463_0.webp' alt='_jaharrhy.webp' height='149' width='167' />
link:: https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/
name:: ~jaharrhy
description:: My labnet garden, giving old web vibes.
```

</div>
I have some code, that turns the above into this:

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
```jsx
<Project image="/asset/_jaharrhy_1738274907463_0.webp" link="https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/" name="~jaharrhy" description="My labnet garden, giving old web vibes." />
```

</div>
During this I also make note of `<img src='/asset/_jaharrhy_1738274907463_0.webp' alt='_jaharrhy.webp' height='149' width='167' />`, parse it using Regex, and keep a record of it separate to the markdown, so later on I can bundle up all assets referenced by my graph, and create an asset manifest I can later upload to cloud storage.

I also support embedding:

<div class="ml-[calc(1*1rem)] mb-8">
Images, using the above method of regular expressions.

Excalidraw drawings.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Logseq has native support for doing a `/draw` slash command, giving me an embedded Excalidraw UI in Logseq.

I simply export these to SVG, saving a reference to this in an `<img ... />` tag and adding another asset to the asset manifest.

</div>
Embedding pages _in_ pages.

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
Doing `{{embed [[Example]]}}` will embed the document visually in Logseq, I can just find these and call my already in use `get_page` to get the content of any page, and spit out its markdown directly into the document.

_I plan on the ability to embed blocks, i.e. sections of documents from places into other places._

Still need to figure out exactly how to denote that something is a reference visually.

</div>
Raw HTML

<div class="ml-[calc(2*1rem)] mb-8">
`@@html ... @@` in Logseq will render raw HTML I can see in the editor, I just strip these from the output so my parser in the Astro side kicks in.
