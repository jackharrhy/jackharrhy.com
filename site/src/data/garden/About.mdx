Hi, I'm Jack.

You can find what I'm up to over on my [[now]] page, the gist is I'm at [Spellbook](https://www.spellbook.legal/) working on AI stuff, and spending too much time on personal projects with no revenue potential.

Previously I've worked for [C-CORE](https://www.c-core.ca/), [CoLab Software](https://bluedropism.com/), and [Bluedrop](https://www.colabsoftware.com/).

Attended [Memorial University of Newfoundland](https://www.mun.ca/) from 2017 to ~2023, but gave up trying to complete up my undergrad.

Survived cancer not [once](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/teens-cancer-sobeys-childrens-wish-1.4636188), but [_twice_](https://www.instagram.com/jackarthurharrhy/p/CI1WeOKAS68/).

Grew up in [Ystrad Mynach, Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ystrad_Mynach), moved to [St. John's, Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador), in 2008.
